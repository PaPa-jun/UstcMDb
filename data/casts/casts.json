Born to mother Lynne, a nurse, and father Ron, a businessman of Polish descent, Wachowski grew up in Chicago and formed a tight creative relationship with her sister Lilly. After the siblings dropped out of college, they started a construction business and wrote screenplays. Their 1995 script, Assassins (1995), was made into a movie, leading to a Warner Bros contract. After that time, the Wachowskis devoted themselves to their movie careers. In 2012, during interviews for Cloud Atlas and in her acceptance speech for the Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award, Lana spoke about her experience of being a transgender woman, sacrificing her much cherished anonymity out of a sense of responsibility. Lana is known to be extremely well-read, loves comic books and exploring ideas of imaginary worlds, and was inspired by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) in creating Cloud Atlas.",

Later he worked as a buyer for Finnish film distributor and met\nFinnish Markus Selin in Los Angeles. They\nbecame friends and started writing a screenplay called \"Arctic Heat\".\nThe project started fast and soon they had\nChuck Norris signed on leading role for the\nfilm. But with money problems shooting schedule didn't hold and Norris\nleft the project, but Selin and Harlin got\nMike Norris for the leading role.\nThey wrote new script,\nBorn American (1986), and got\nfinancial help from USA. In the year 1986\nBorn American (1986) was finished\nand the most expensive Finnish film ever opened in USA in over 1,000\ntheaters and reached no 9.The film wasn't successful in Finland, where it was banned. Harlin\nmoved to Los Angeles and got a job from Halloween (1978) producer\nIrwin Yablans who offered him script of\n\"Prison\" to film. Film was made with low budget and distributed with\nonly 42 copies. In the same year 1988 he got a job from New Line Cinema\nto direct\nA Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master (1988)\nafter meeting producer Robert Shaye\nnumerous times, who at the first didn't want Harlin to direct the film.\nIt became the highest-grossing film in the series, though its budget\nwas seven times greater than the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"\nfilm.20th Century Fox wanted Harlin to direct the\nAndrew Dice Clay rock'n roll comedy\nThe Adventures of Ford Fairlane (1990)\nand also a sequel to Die Hard (1988).\nHarlin made the both, but only\nDie Hard 2 (1990) was commercially\nsuccessful, with over 239 million dollar worldwide gross. Next he\ndirected Cliffhanger (1993) with\nSylvester Stallone which made $255\nmillion worldwide and was nominated for 3 Oscar's. Before\nCliffhanger (1993) Harlin was hired\nto direct \"Alien³\" but he left the project because of creative\ndifferences.His next film\nCutthroat Island (1995) was a\npirate film made with $100 million budget. Unfortunately it came out\nwithout good promotion and flopped badly. It made only $10 million in\nUSA and for a time became the biggest flop in Hollywood history. But\nfor Harlin, it wasn't a total loss.The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996)\nwas a critical success, but was a box office flop, grossing only $30\nmillion domestically with a $65 million budget.In year 1998, Warner Bros. wanted a summer blockbuster for the year\n1999 and Renny Harlin was the right name to\ndirect. Deep Blue Sea (1999) came\nto theaters after costing 60 million dollars to film and made $160\nmillion worldwide. The film never hit the top spot in the USA but still\ngrossed $73 millions in the USA alone.Harlin was hired to direct\nExorcist: The Beginning (2004)\nafter John Frankenheimer left the job\nand died shortly after it, and\nPaul Schrader was fired. Producers\nknew that Harlin could made a blockbuster even with the weak script,\nand so he did. With $50 million budget the film opened in number 1 and\ngrossed $80 million worldwide.Probably most liked Harlin's film\nMindhunters (2004) was released in\n2004 after years post-production. It was released in USA in 2005 in\nover 1,000 theaters but it only reached 10th place. In 9 weeks it\ngrossed only $4 million dollars.The Covenant (2006) was released in\n2006. With non-famous (but attractive) actors, the film hit the top in\nits opening weekend and became a successful film. With a $20 million\nbudget, it grossed $37 million worldwide and DVD sale brought $20\nmillion more.",

After being scouted at the age of 18, Charlee quickly joined IMG and became a rising star in Australia, before a breakout season at the Fall/Winter 2016 shows which cemented her place as an international star.Fraser's 'star is born' moment came when the iconic hairstylist Guido Palau chopped her long tresses into a chic bob right before she hit the Alexander Wang runway at New York Fashion Week. Charlee was immediately dubbed the \"new face to know\" by American Vogue and caught the eye of top casting directors. That season she walked 40 shows, including Prada, Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, Givenchy and Céline. A proud Awabakal woman, Charlee's success doubled as a historic moment in fashion, she was the first Indigenous Australian model to work with the international fashion houses.Charlee went on to front campaigns for Tom Ford, Céline, Stella McCartney, Givenchy, and Giorgio Armani (among many others), being photographed by the likes of Mario Sorrenti, Mert & Marcus, and Juergen Teller. Her editorial career skyrocketed both locally and abroad, including multiple covers for the Australian and international editions of Vogue and Harper's BAZAAR, and shoots for Dazed, W, Numero, T Magazine, American Vogue, and more. Charlee was only the third Indigenous model to appear on the cover of Australian Vogue in the titles' 56-year history and made history again when she starred in the title's iconic May 2022 all-Indigenous cover, alongside Elaine George, Magnolia Maymuru and Cindy Rostron.In 2020 Charlee moved from New York City back to Australia, where she became the ambassador for First Nations Fashion + Design (FNFD), a not-for-profit organisation that aims to build an ecology of Indigenous artists and talent within the fashion industry.

        "bio": "Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling, acclaimed Academy Award winner writer/director/producer Sir Christopher Nolan CBE was born in London, England. Over the course of more than 25 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made and became one of the most celebrated filmmakers of modern cinema.At 7 years old, Nolan began making short films with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.Nolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan. Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors, including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia (2002), starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins (2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero, and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige (2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight (2008). Co-written with by his brother Jonathan, the film went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also received eight Academy Award nominations. The film is widely considered one of the best comic book adaptations of all times, with Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker receiving an extremely high acclaim. Ledger posthumously became the first Academy Award winning performance in a Nolan film.In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the Sci-Fi thriller Inception (2010), starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, which he directed and produced from his own original screenplay that he worked on for almost a decade. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the most discussed and debated films of the year, and of all times. Among its many honors, Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by his peers with a W.G.A. Award accolade, as well as D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards nominations for his work on the film.As one of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted Nolan to produce their revamped Superman movie Man of Steel (2013), which opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote, and produced the Science-Fiction epic Interstellar (2014), starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014, to positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670 million dollars worldwide.In July 2017, Nolan released his acclaimed War epic Dunkirk (2017), that earned him his first Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards, as well as winning an additional 3 Oscars. In 2020 he released his mind-bending Sci-Fi espionage thriller Tenet (2020) starring John David Washington in the lead role. Released during the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie grossed relatively less than Nolan's previous blockbusters, though it did do good numbers compared to other movies in that period of time. Hailed as Nolan's most complex film yet, the film was one of Nolan's less-acclaimed films at the time, yet slowly built a fan-base following in later years.In July 2023, Nolan released his highly acclaimed biographic drama Oppenheimer (2023) starring Nolan's frequent collaborator Cillian Murphy- in the lead role for the first time in a Nolan film. The movie was a cultural phenomenon that on top of grossing almost 1 billion dollars at the Worldwide Box office, also swept the 2023/2024 award-season and gave Nolan his first Oscars, BAFTAs, Golden Globes, D.G.A. and P.G.A. Awards, as well as a handful of regional critics-circles awards and a W.G.A. nomination. Cillian's performance as quantum physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was highly acclaimed as well, and became the first lead performance in a Nolan film to win the Academy Award.During 2023, Nolan also received a fellowship from the British Film Institute (BFI). In March 2024, it was announced that Nolan is to be knighted by King Charles III and from now on will go by the title 'Sir Christopher Nolan'.Nolan resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Academy Award winner producer Dame Emma Thomas, and their children. Sir Nolan and Dame Thomas also have their own production company, Syncopy.",

        "bio": "Donna Reed was born in the midwestern town of Denison, Iowa, on January\n27, 1921, as Donna Belle Mullenger. A small town - a population of less\nthan 3,000 people - Denison was located by the Boyer River, and was the\ncounty seat of Crawford County. Donna grew up as a farm girl, much like\nmany young girls in western Iowa, except for one thing - Donna was very\nbeautiful. That wasn't to say that others weren't as pretty, it's just\nthat Donna's beauty stood out from all the other local girls, so much\nso that she won a beauty contest in Denison. Upon graduation from high\nschool Donna left for college in Los Angeles, in the hopes of\neventually entering movies. While at Los Angeles City College, she\npursued her dream by participating in several college stage\nproductions. In addition to the plays, she also won the title of Campus\nQueen. At one of those stage plays Donna was spotted by an MGM talent\nscout and was signed to a contract. Her first film was a minor role in\nMGM's The Getaway (1941). That was followed by a small part in Babes on Broadway (1941), with\nMickey Rooney and Judy Garland as a secretary. She then won her breakthrough role in Shadow of the Thin Man (1941). Afterwards, MGM began giving her\nbetter parts, in films such as The Bugle Sounds (1942), The Courtship of Andy Hardy (1942) and The Man from Down Under (1943). In 1944\nshe received second billing playing Carol Halliday in See Here, Private Hargrove (1944), a comedy\nabout a reporter drafted into the army who eventually meets up with\nDonna's character as a worker in the canteen. The following year Donna\nstarred in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), her best role to date. It was a love story set in\nLondon in 1890. It got mixed critical reviews but did well at the\nbox-office. Donna was now one of the leading ladies of Hollywood. In\n1946 she starred in what is probably her best-known role, as the wife\nof James Stewart in the classic It's a Wonderful Life (1946). This timeless story is a holiday\nstaple to this day. The film also starred Lionel Barrymore and Thomas Mitchell. The next\nyear Donna starred as Ann Daniels in Paramount's Beyond Glory (1948) with Alan Ladd,\nwhich did well at the box-office. Her next role was the strongest she\nhad had yet--Chicago Deadline (1949), again with Ladd. It was one of the best mystery\ndramas to come out of Hollywood in a long time, and did very well at\nthe box office. As the 1940s faded out and the 1950s stormed in,\nDonna's roles got bigger but were mainly of the wholesome,\ngirl-next-door type. In 1953, however, she starred as the hostess\nAlma in the widely acclaimed From Here to Eternity (1953). She was so good in that film she\nwas nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting\nActress, beating out such veterans as Thelma Ritter and Marjorie Rambeau. The film\nitself won for Best Picture and remains a classic to this day. Later\nthat year Donna starred in The Caddy (1953), a comedy with Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.\nThree years later she landed the role of Sacajawea in The Far Horizons (1955), the\nstory of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, starring Charlton Heston and Fred MacMurray.\nAfter finishing The Whole Truth (1958), Donna began her own TV series (produced by her\nhusband), The Donna Reed Show (1958), a hit that ran for eight years. She was so effective\nin the show that she was nominated for TV's prestigious Emmy Award as\nBest Actress every year from 1959-1962. She was far more popular in TV\nthan on the screen. After the run of the program, Donna took some time\naway from show business before coming back in a couple of made-for-TV\nmovies (in 1974, she had made a feature called Welcome to Arrow Beach (1973), but it was\nnever released). She did get the role of Ellie Ewing Farlow in the hit\nTV series Dallas (1978) during the 1984-85 season. It was to be her final\npublic performance. On January 14, 1986, less than two weeks before her\n65th birthday, she died of pancreatic cancer in Beverly Hills,\nCalifornia. Grover Asmus, her husband, created the Donna Reed\nFoundation for the Performing Arts in her hometown of Denison. The\nfoundation helps others who desire a career in the arts. Donna never\nforgot her roots. She was still a farm girl at heart.",

Brown III was born in 1959 in Urbana, Ohio, to Joyce Helen (Eldridge), a concert pianist, conductor, and composer, and Clarence J. \"Bud\" Brown, Jr., who helped manage the Brown Publishing Company, the family-owned newspaper started by Clancy's grandfather, Clarence J. Brown. Clancy's father and grandfather were also Republican congressmen from the same Ohio district, and Clancy spent much of his youth in close proximity to Washington, D.C. He plied his dramatic talents in the Chicago theatre scene before moving onto feature film with a sinister debut performance bullying Sean Penn inside a youth reformatory in Bad Boys (1983). He portrayed Viktor the Monster in the unusual spin on the classic Frankenstein story in The Bride (1985), before scoring one of his best roles to date as the evil Kurgan hunting fellow immortals Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery across four centuries of time in Highlander (1986).Brown played a corrupt American soldier in the Walter Hill-directed hyper-violent action film Extreme Prejudice (1987), another deranged killer in Shoot to Kill (1988) and a brutal prison guard, who eventually somewhat \"befriends\" wrongfully convicted banker Tim Robbins, in the moving The Shawshank Redemption (1994). His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks (1994), Gargoyles (1994) and Superman: The Animated Series (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a \"tough-as-nails\" drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber (1997).The video gaming industry took notice of Clancy's vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003). His voice is also the character of cranky crustacean Mr. Eugene H. Krabs in the highly successful SpongeBob SquarePants (1999) animated series and films, and he contributed voices to The Batman (2004), Jackie Chan Adventures (2000) and Justice League (2001) animated series.

Cobb, one of the premier character actors in American film for\nthree decades in the post-World War II period, was born Leo Jacoby in\nNew York City's Lower East Side on December 8, 1911. The son of a\nJewish newspaper editor, young Leo was a child prodigy in music,\nmastering the violin and the harmonica. Any hopes of a career as a\nviolin virtuoso were dashed when he broke his wrist, but his talent on\nthe harmonica may have brought him his first professional success. At\nthe age of 16 or 17 he ran away from home to Hollywood to try to break\ninto motion pictures as an actor. He reportedly made his film debut as\na member of\nBorrah Minevitch and His Harmonica Rascals\n(their first known movie appearance was in the 1929 two-reeler Boyhood\nDays), but that cannot be substantiated. However, it's known that after\nLeo was unable to find work he returned to New York City, where he\nattended New York University at night to study accounting while\nacting in radio dramas during the day.An older Cobb tried his luck in California once more, making his debut\nas a professional stage actor at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1931. After\nagain returning to his native New York, he made his Broadway debut as a\nsaloonkeeper in a dramatization of\nFyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and\nPunishment, but it closed after 15 performances (later in his career,\nDostoevsky would prove more of a charm, with Cobb's role as Father\nKaramazov in\nThe Brothers Karamazov (1958)\ngarnering him his second Oscar nomination),Cobb joined the politically progressive Group Theater in 1935 and made\na name for himself in Clifford Odets'\npolitically liberal dramas Waiting for Lefty and Til the Day I Die,\nappearing in both plays that year in casts that included\nElia Kazan, who later became famous as a film\ndirector. Cobb also appeared in the 1937 Group Theater production of\nOdets' Golden Boy, playing the role of Mr. Carp, in a cast that also\nincluded Kazan, Julius Garfinkle (later better known under his stage\nname of John Garfield), and\nMartin Ritt, all of whom later came\nunder the scrutiny of the House Un-American Activities Committee during\nthe heyday of the McCarthy Red Scare hysteria more than a decade later.\nCobb took over the role of Mr. Bonaparte, the protagonist's father, in\nthe 1939 film version of the play, despite the fact that he was not yet\n30 years old. The role of a patriarch suited him, and he'd play many\nmore in his film career.It was as a different kind of patriarch that he scored his greatest\nsuccess. Cobb achieved immortality by giving life to the character of\nWilly Loman in the original 1949 Broadway production of\nArthur Miller's Death of a\nSalesman. His performance was a towering achievement that ranks with\nsuch performances as Edwin Booth as Richard III and\nJohn Barrymore as Hamlet in the\nannals of the American theater. Cobb later won an Emmy nomination as\nWilly when he played the role in a made-for-TV movie of the play\n(Death of a Salesman (1966)).\nMiller said that he wrote the role with Cobb in mind.Before triumphing as Miller's Salesman, Cobb had appeared on Broadway\nonly a handful of times in the 1940s, including in\nErnest Hemingway's The Fifth Column\n(1940), Odets' \"Clash by Night\" (1942) and the US Army Air Force's\nWinged Victory (1943-44). Later he reprised the role of Joe Bonaparte's\nfather in the 1952 revival of Golden Boy opposite Garfield as his son,\nand appeared the following year in The Emperor's Clothes. His final\nBroadway appearance was as King Lear in the Repertory Theatre of\nLincoln Center's 1968 production of Shakespeare's play.Aside from his possible late 1920s movie debut and his 1934 appearance\nin the western\nThe Vanishing Shadow (1934),\nCobb's film career proper began in 1937 with the westerns\nNorth of the Rio Grande (1937)\n(in which he was billed as Lee Colt) and\nRustlers' Valley (1937) and\nspanned nearly 40 years until his death. After a hiatus while serving\nin the Army Air Force during World War II, Cobb's movie career resumed\nin 1946. He continued to play major supporting roles in prestigious\nA-list pictures. His movie career reached its artistic peak in the\n1950s, when he was twice nominated for Best Supporting Actor Academy\nAwards, for his role as Johnny Friendly in\nOn the Waterfront (1954) and as\nthe father in\nThe Brothers Karamazov (1958).\nOther memorable supporting roles in the 1950s included the sagacious\nJudge Bernstein in\nThe Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1956),\nas the probing psychiatrist Dr. Luther in\nThe Three Faces of Eve (1957)\nand as the volatile Juror #3 in\n12 Angry Men (1957).It was in the 1950s that Cobb achieved the sort of fame that most\nartists dreaded: he was called before the House Un-American Activities\nCommittee on charges that he was or had been a Communist. The charges\nwere rooted in Cobb's membership in the Group Theater in the 1930s.\nOther Group Theater members already investigated by HUAC included\nClifford Odets and\nElia Kazan, both of whom provided friendly\ntestimony before the committee, and\nJohn Garfield, who did not.Cobb's own persecution by HUAC had already caused a nervous breakdown\nin his wife, and he decided to appear as a friendly witness in order to\npreserve her sanity and his career, by bringing the inquisition to a\nhalt. Appearing before the committee in 1953, he named names and thus\nsaved his career. Ironically, he would win his first Oscar nomination\nin On the Waterfront (1954)\ndirected and written by fellow HUAC informers Kazan and\nBudd Schulberg. The film can be seen as a\nstalwart defense of informing, as epitomized by the character Terry\nMalloy's testimony before a Congressional committee investigating\nracketeering on the waterfront.Major films in which Cobb appeared after reaching his career plateau\ninclude Otto Preminger's adaptation of\nLeon Uris' ode to the birth of Israel,\nExodus (1960); the Cinerama spectacle\nHow the West Was Won (1962);\nthe James Coburn spy spoofs,\nOur Man Flint (1966) and\nIn Like Flint (1967);\nClint Eastwood's first detective film,\nCoogan's Bluff (1968); and\nlegendary director William Wyler's last\nfilm,\nThe Liberation of L.B. Jones (1970).In addition to his frequent supporting roles in film, Cobb often\nappeared on television. He played Judge Henry Garth on\nThe Virginian (1962) from\n1962-66 and also had a regular role as the attorney David Barrett on\nThe Young Lawyers (1969)\nfrom 1970-71. Cobb also appeared in made-for-TV movies and made\nfrequent guest appearances on other TV shows. His last major Hollywood\nmovie role was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in\nThe Exorcist (1973).Lee J. Cobb died of a heart attack in Woodland Hills, California, on\nFebruary 11, 1976, at the age of 64. He is buried in Mount Sinai\nMemorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Though he will long\nbe remembered for many of his successful supporting performances in the\nmovies, it is as the stage's first Willy Loman in which he achieved\nimmortality as an actor. Bearing in mind that the role was written for\nhim, it is through Willy that he will continue to have an influence on\nAmerican drama far into the future, for as long as Death of a Salesman\nis revived.",

From there, it was to Montreal as a nightclub dancer and then Broadway with her debut in \"Fair Game (1957)\". By 1963, she appeared on the TV series The Doctors (1963), but she gained notice for her role in Goodbye Charlie (1964). Ellen then took time off to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio.Her big break came when she was cast as the female lead in The Last Picture Show (1971).

His mother, Julia (Moccello),\nwas a homemaker. His father, Daniel, Sr., was a small business owner\nwhose ventures included a dry cleaning shop, a dairy outlet, a diner,\nand a pool hall.While growing up in Asbury Park, his parents sent him to private\nschools. He attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel grammar school and\nOratory Prep School. Following graduation in 1962, he took a job as a\ncosmetician at his sister's beauty salon. A year later, he enrolled at\nNew York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts so he could learn more\nabout cosmetology. While at the academy, he fell in love with acting\nand decided to further pursue an acting career. During this time, he\nmet another aspiring actor\nMichael Douglas at the National\nPlaywrights Conference in Waterford, Connecticut. The two would later\ngo on to collaborate on numerous projects. Soon after he also met an\nactress named Rhea Perlman. The two fell in\nlove and moved in together. They were married in 1982 and had three\nchildren together.In 1968, Danny landed his first part in a movie when he appeared as a\nthug in the obscure\nDreams of Glass (1970). Despite\nthis minor triumph, Danny became discouraged with the film industry and\ndecided to focus on stage productions. He made his Off-Broadway debut\nin 1969 in \"The Man With the Flower in His Mouth.\" He followed this up\nwith stage roles in \"The Shrinking Bride,\" and \"Lady Liberty.\" In 1975,\nhe was approached by director Milos Forman\nand Michael Douglas about\nappearing in the film version of\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),\nwhich would star Jack Nicholson\nin the leading role. With box office success almost guaranteed and a\nchance for national exposure, Danny agreed to the role. The movie\nbecame a huge hit, both critically and financially, and still ranks\ntoday as one the greatest movies of all time. Unfortunately, the movie\ndid very little to help Danny's career. In the years following, he was\nrelegated to small movie roles and guest appearances on television\nshows. His big break came in 1978 when he auditioned for a role on an\nABC sitcom pilot called Taxi (1978),\nwhich centered around taxi cab drivers at a New York City garage. Danny\nauditioned for the role of dispatcher Louie DePalma. At the audition,\nthe producers told Danny that he needed to show more attitude in order\nto get the part. He then slammed down the script and yelled, \"Who wrote\nthis sh**?\" The producers, realizing he was perfect for the part,\nbrought him on board. The show was a huge success, running from 1978 to\n1983.Louie DePalma, played flawlessly by Danny, became one of the most\nmemorable (and reviled) characters in television history. While he was\nuniversally hated by TV viewers, he was well-praised by critics,\nwinning an Emmy award and being nominated three other times. Throughout\nthe 1980s and 1990s, Danny maintained his status as a great character\nactor with memorable roles in movies like\nRomancing the Stone (1984),\nRuthless People (1986),\nThrow Momma from the Train (1987)\nand Twins (1988). He also had a great deal\nof success behind the camera, directing movies like\nThe War of the Roses (1989)\nand Hoffa (1992). In 1992, Danny was\nintroduced to a new generation of moviegoers when he was given the role\nof The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot in\nTim Burton's highly successful\nBatman Returns (1992). This earned\nhim a nomination for Best Villain at the MTV Movie Awards. That same\nyear, along with his wife\nRhea Perlman, Danny co-founded Jersey\nFilms, which has produced many popular films and TV shows, including\nPulp Fiction (1994),\nGet Shorty (1995),\nMan on the Moon (1999) and\nErin Brockovich (2000). DeVito\nhas many directing credits to his name as well, including\nThrow Momma from the Train (1987),\nThe War of the Roses (1989),\nHoffa (1992),\nDeath to Smoochy (2002) and the\nupcoming St. Sebastian.In 2006, he returned to series television in the FX comedy series\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005).\nWith a prominent role in a hit series, Devito's comic talents were now\non display for a new generation of television viewers. In 2012, he\nprovided the title voice role in Dr. Seuss'\nThe Lorax (2012).These days, he continues to work with many of today's top talents as an\nactor, director and producer.",

In 2004, she won the Chopard Thophy of Female Revelation at the Cannes Film Festival. In 2005, Cotillard won the César award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance of Tina Lombardi in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's A Very Long Engagement (2004).In 2007, Cotillard received international recognition for her iconic portrayal of Édith Piaf in La Vie En Rose (2007). Director Olivier Dahan cast Cotillard to play the legendary French singer because to him, her eyes were like those of \"Piaf\". The fact that she can sing also helped Cotillard land the role of \"Piaf\", although most of the singing in the film is that of Piaf's. The role won Cotillard the Academy Award for Best Actress along with a César, a Lumière Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe. That made her only the second actress to win an acting Oscar performing in a language other than English next to Sophia Loren (Two Women (1960)). Only two male performers (Roberto Benigni for Life Is Beautiful (1997) and Robert De Niro for The Godfather Part II (1974)) have won an Oscar for solely non-English parts. Trevor Nunn called her portrayal of \"Piaf\" \"one of the greatest performances on film ever\". At the Berlin International Film Festival, where the film premiered, Cotillard was given a 15-minute standing ovation. When she won the César, Alain Delon presented the award and announced the winner as \"La Môme Marion\" (The Kid Marion), he also praised her at the stage saying: \"Marion, I give you this César. I think this César is for a great great actress, and I know what I'm talking about\".Cotillard has worked much more frequently in English-language movies following her Academy Award recognition. In 2009, she acted opposite Johnny Depp in Michael Mann's Public Enemies (2009), and later that year played Luisa Contini in Rob Marshall's musical Nine (2009) and received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Time magazine ranked her as the fifth best performance by a female in 2009. The following year, she took on the main antagonist role, Mal, in Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), and in 2011 she had memorable parts in Midnight in Paris (2011) and Contagion (2011) and reteamed with Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight Rises (2012).In 2011 and 2012 respectively, Cotillard appeared on the top of Le Figaro's list of the highest paid actors in France, it was the first time in nine years that a female topped the list. Cotillard was also the highest paid foreign actress in Hollywood.In 2012, Cotillard received wide-spread critical acclaim for her role as the legless orca trainer Stéphanie in Rust and Bone (2012). The film was a box office hit in France and received a ten-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening at the 65th Cannes Film Festival. Cotillard won the Globe de Cristal (France's equivalent to the Golden Globe), the Étoile d'Or award and was nominated for the Golden Globes, SAG, BAFTA, Critics' Choice and César Awards for her performance in the film. Cate Blanchett wrote an op-ed for Variety praising Cotillard's performance in \"Rust and Bone\", the two actresses competed for the Academy Awards for Best Actress in 2008, Cate was nominated for her performance in Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007) and Marion for her performance in La Vie En Rose (2007) and Cotillard won the Oscar.She had her first leading role in an American movie in 2013, in James Gray's The Immigrant (2013), in which she played Ewa Cybulska, a Polish immigrant who wants to experience the American dream. Cotillard received wide-spread acclaim for her performance in the film at the 66th Cannes Film Festival, where the film premiered, and also won several critics awards. In 2014, Cotillard played Sandra in the Belgian film Two Days, One Night (2014) by the Dardenne brothers. Her performance was unanimously praised at the 67th Cannes Film Festival, earned several critics awards, Cotillard won her first European Award for Best Actress and also received her second Oscar nomination and her sixth César award nomination.In 2015, she played Lady Macbeth opposite Michael Fassbender in Justin Kurzel's Macbeth (2015) and voiced two animated movies: The Little Prince (2015) in which she voiced The Rose, and April and the Extraordinary World (2015), in which she voiced the lead role, Avril. Her 2016 included Nicole Garcia's From the Land of the Moon (2016), Xavier Dolan's It's Only the End of the World (2016), Justin Kurzel's Assassin's Creed (2016), in which she worked again with her Macbeth co-star Michael Fassbender; and Robert Zemeckis's Allied (2016), with Brad Pitt.",

        "bio": "Toshiro Mifune achieved more worldwide fame than any other Japanese actor of his century. He was born in Tsingtao, China, to Japanese parents and grew up in Dalian. He did not set foot in Japan until he was 21. His father was an importer and a commercial photographer, and young Toshiro worked in his father's studio for a time after graduating from Dalian Middle School. He was automatically drafted into the Japanese army when he turned 20, and enlisted in the Air Force where he was attached to the Aerial Photography Unit for the duration of the World War II. In 1947 he took a test for Kajirô Yamamoto, who recommended him to director Senkichi Taniguchi, thus leading to Mifune's first film role in These Foolish Times II (1947). Mifune then met and bonded with director Akira Kurosawa, and the two joined to become the most prominent actor-director pairing in all Japanese cinema. Beginning with Drunken Angel (1948), Mifune appeared in 16 of Kurosawa's films, most of which have become world-renowned classics. In Kurosawa's pictures, especially Rashomon (1950), Mifune would become the most famous Japanese actor in the world. A dynamic and ferocious actor, he excelled in action roles, but also had the depth to plumb intricate and subtle dramatic parts. A personal rift during the filming of Red Beard (1965) ended the Mifune-Kurosawa collaboration, but Mifune continued to perform leading roles in major films both in Japan and in foreign countries. He was twice named Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival (for Yojimbo (1961) and Red Beard (1965)). In 1963 he formed his own production company, directing one film and producing several others. In his later years he gained new fame in the title role of the American TV miniseries Shogun (1980), and appeared infrequently in cameo roles after that. His last years were plagued with Alzheimer's Syndrome and he died of organ failure in 1997, a few months before the death of the director with whose name he will forever be linked, Akira Kurosawa.",

However, Billy Batts is better known to a legion of crime-film fans as the talented actor, musician, and comedian Frank Vincent. He was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, but was raised in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey. Frank studied music at St. Pauls Grammar School and became a keen drummer at a young age, while his father introduced him to the dramatic arts. Vincent went on to became quite an accomplished musician and played with some of the key 1960s recording artists including Trini López, Del Shannon and Paul Anka. In 1975 Vincent appeared before the camera for the first time in the low-budget The Death Collector (1976) where he was noticed by acclaimed director Martin Scorsese, who cast Frank in three iconic American films: the first saw Frank play the insolent Salvi in Raging Bull (1980), secondly as the aforementioned made man Billy Batts in Goodfellas (1990) being bumped off by Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro, and once again as Frank Marino in Casino (1995). Frank Vincent appeared in over fifty movies, and set the pace as one of the cinema's most versatile and resourceful character actors. With the recognition of his talents, various new opportunities work followed, and Frank lent his skills to contributing and appearing on video games, in television commercials and even rock-music clips with artists including DMX, T-Boz and Hype Williams. He also had the role of Phil Leotardo in the legendary gangster TV series The Sopranos (1999).Frank Vincent was also the proud recipient of the Italian American Entertainer of the Year Award, and was also acknowledged with a Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the Back East Picture Show.",

Her grandfather was Major General Peter Blunt, and her uncle is MP Crispin Blunt. Emily received a rigorous education at Ibstock Place School, a co-ed private school at Roehampton. However, young Emily Blunt had a stammer, since she was a kid of 8. Her mother took her to relaxation classes, which did not do anything. She reached a turning point at 12, when a teacher cleverly asked her to play a character with a different voice and said, \"I really believe in you\". Blunt ended up using a northern accent, and it did the trick, her stammer disappeared.From 1999 - 2001, Blunt went to Hurtwood House, the top co-ed boarding school where she would excel at sport, cello and singing. She also had two years of drama studies at Hurtwood's theatre course. In August 2000, she was chosen to perform at the Edinburgh Festival. She was signed up by an agent, Kenneth Mcreddie, who led her to the West End and the BBC, scoring her roles in several period dramas on stage as well as on TV productions, such as Foyle's War (2002), Henry VIII (2003) and Empire (2005). In 2001, she appeared as \"Gwen Cavendish\" opposite Dame Judi Dench in Sir Peter Hall's production of \"The Royal Family\" at Haymarket Theatre. For that role, she won the Evening Standard Award for Best Newcomer. In 2002, she played \"Juliet\" in \"Romeo and Juliet\" at the prestigious Chichester Festival.Blunt's career ascended to international fame after she starred as \"Isolda\" opposite Alex Kingston in Warrior Queen (2003). A year later, she won critical acclaim for her breakout performance as \"Tamsin\", a well-educated, cynical and deceptive 16-year-old beauty in My Summer of Love (2004), a story of two lonely girls from the opposite ends of the social heap. Emily Blunt and her co-star, Natalie Press, shared an Evening Standard British Film award for Most Promising Newcomer. In 2005, she spent a few months in Australia filming Irresistible (2006) with Susan Sarandon and Sam Neill. Blunt gave an impressive performance as \"Mara\", a cunning young destroyer who acts crazy and surreptitiously provokes paranoia in others. She also continued her work on British television, starring as \"Natasha\" in Stephen Poliakoff's Gideon's Daughter (2005), opposite Bill Nighy, a role that won her a 2007 Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role.She continued the line of playing manipulative characters as \"Emily\", a caustic put-upon assistant to Meryl Streep's lead in The Devil Wears Prada (2006). Blunt's performance with a neurotic twist added a dimension of sarcasm to the comedy, and gained her much attention as well as new jobs: in two dramas opposite Tom Hanks, then in the title role in the period drama, The Young Victoria (2009). Her most recent works include appearances as antiques dealer \"Gwen Conliffe\" in The Wolfman (2010) and as the ballerina in The Adjustment Bureau (2011).Emily is a highly versatile actress and a multifaceted person. Her talents include singing and playing cello; she is also skilled at horseback riding.On August 28, 2009, Blunt and Krasinski announced their engagement. The couple married on July 10, 2010, at the estate of their friend, George Clooney, on Lake Como in Italy. Blunt and Krasinski live in the Los Angeles area, California, and have two children.",

The family lived in Newton until his parents divorced in 1973, when Damon and his brother moved with his mother to Cambridge. He grew up in a stable community, and was raised near actor Ben Affleck.Damon attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and he performed in a number of theater productions during his time there. He attended Harvard University as an English major. While in Harvard, he kept on skipping classes to pursue acting projects, which included the TNT original film, Rising Son (1990), and prep-school drama, School Ties (1992). It was until his film, Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), was expected to be a big success that he decided to drop out of university completely. Arriving in Hollywood, Matt managed to get his first break with a part in the romantic comedy, Mystic Pizza (1988). However, the film did not do too well and his film career failed to take off. Not letting failure discourage him from acting, he went for another audition, and managed to get a starring role in School Ties (1992).

Ryan was the second of their two children, with an older sister, Mandi. His ancestry is French-Canadian, as well as English, Scottish, and Irish. The Gosling family moved to Cornwall, Ontario, where Ryan grew up and was home-schooled by his mother. He also attended Gladstone Public School and Cornwall Collegiate & Vocational School, where he excelled in Drama and Fine Arts. The family then relocated to Burlington, Ontario, where Ryan attended Lester B. Pearson High School.Ryan first performed as a singer at talent contests with Mandi. He attended an open audition in Montreal for the TV series \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (The All New Mickey Mouse Club (1989)) in January 1993 and beat out 17,000 other aspiring actors for a a spot on the show. While appearing on \"MMC\" for two years, he lived with co-star Justin Timberlake's family.Though he received no formal acting training, after \"MMC,\" Gosling segued into an acting career, appearing on the TV series Young Hercules (1998) and Breaker High (1997), as well as the films The Slaughter Rule (2002), Murder by Numbers (2002), and Remember the Titans (2000). He first attracted serious critical attention with his performance as the Jewish neo-Nazi in the controversial film The Believer (2001), which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. He was cast in the part by writer-director Henry Bean, who believed that Gosling's strict upbringing gave him the insight to understand the character Danny, whose obsessiveness with the Judaism he was born into turns to hatred. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as Best Male Lead in 2002 for the role and won the Golden Aries award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics.After appearing in the sleeper The Notebook (2004) in 2004, Gosling won the dubious honor of being named one of the 50 Hottest Bachelors by People Magazine. More significantly, he was named the Male Star of Tomorrow at the 2004 Show West convention of movie exhibitors.Gosling reached a summit of his profession with his performance in Half Nelson (2006), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor. In a short time, he has established himself as one of the finest actors of his generation. Throughout the subsequent decade, he has become all three of an internet fixation, a box office star, and a critical darling, having headlined Blue Valentine (2010), Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011), Drive (2011), The Ides of March (2011), The Place Beyond the Pines (2012), The Nice Guys (2016), and La La Land (2016). In 2017, he starred in the long-awaited science fiction sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017), with Harrison Ford.Ryan has two children with his partner, actress Eva Mendes.",

His mother was actress Patty Duke.\nAt the time of his birth, his biological father was believed to be entertainer Desi Arnaz Jr., but Astin\ndiscovered through a DNA test in the 1990s that his biological father is music promoter Michael Tell, who was married to Patty Duke in 1970. Sean was raised by his stepfather, actor John Astin, who married Patty Duke in 1972 and whose surname Sean took. Sean's mother was of Irish and more distant German ancestry, and Sean's biological father is of Austrian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent.At age nine, Sean starred with his mother in the after-school special Please Don't Hit Me, Mom (1981). Followed by Sean's feature debut The Goonies (1985) and since then, he has had a steady stream of roles. Starring in Toy Soldiers (1991), Where the Day Takes You (1992), Rudy (1993) and Harrison Bergeron (1995).\nHe directed and co-produced the short film Kangaroo Court (1994), which was nominated in the best short film category at The 67th Annual Academy Awards (1995). Sean's adoptive father John Astin was nominated for the same award in 1969.Sean experienced another career breakthrough with his role as the epitome of loyal sidekicks, Samwise Gamgee, in Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, released in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Along with the many awards bestowed upon the trilogy (particularly its final installment The Return of the King), Sean received nominations for his own performance. He took home the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor, and awards from the Las Vegas Film Critics Society, the Seattle Film Critics, the Utah Film Critics Association, and the Phoenix Film Critics Society. As an ensemble, the Return of the King cast received awards from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures and the Screen Actors Guild.

The principle of #Run3rd is that Sean runs first for himself, since running is ultimately a solitary act, second for his ever-patient and supportive family, and third for others. #Run3rd has grown to include a team of runners, walkers, and others who dedicate their activities to the causes of others. A $25,000 grant from the Ironman Foundation will allow the charity to fund after school running programs for children in under-served school districts. More information on #Run3rd, including sponsored 5Ks, is available at run3rd.com.Sean has served as a philanthropist on the board of several non-profit organizations, including the Creative Coalition, National Center for Family Literacy, and Los Angeles Valley College's Patrons Association and Arts Council.

        "bio": "Alfredo James \"Al\" 'Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema's most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.He was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.After appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz's \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in The Panic in Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Me, Natalie (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in The Godfather (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.Coppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with And Justice for All (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like Cruising (1980) and Author! Author! (1982).Pacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.Returning to the Corleones, Pacino made The Godfather Part III (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie and Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Scent of a Woman (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.The next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito's Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Looking for Richard (1996). During this period, City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and The Devil's Advocate (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in The Insider (1999) and Any Given Sunday (1999).In the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean's Thirteen (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Angels in America (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie You Don't Know Jack (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.Never wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \"Godfather\" co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Solá, who is 36 years his junior.As of 2022, Pacino is 82-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and continues to appear regularly in film.",

Even in his nice-guy roles in Field of Dreams (1989) and Operation Dumbo Drop (1995), you get the impression that something is smoldering inside of him. He was born in Newark, New Jersey, and was adopted by Mary (Edgar), a township clerk, and Alfred Liotta, an auto parts store owner. He studied acting at the University of Miami, where he became friends with Steven Bauer (Scarface (1983), Thief of Hearts (1984)). He spent his first years acting in TV: Another World (1964), a TV movie and several short-lived series. He broke into movies with the black comedy Something Wild (1986), which garnered him rave reviews. Originally unable to get a reading, he was recommended for the part by Melanie Griffith (then married to Bauer).Following the success Something Wild (1986), he received more offers in the \"psycho\" vein, but refused them to avoid being typecast. Instead, he made \"little movies\" like Dominick and Eugene (1988), which earned him standing as an actor's actor, and Field of Dreams (1989), whose success always surprised him. When he heard Martin Scorsese was casting Goodfellas (1990), he lobbied hard for the part of Henry Hill. The film's huge success brought him wide popularity and garnered him star billing in future films such as Article 99 (1992), Unlawful Entry (1992), and Unforgettable (1996).Liotta died on May 26, 2022, aged 67, in his sleep while filming on location in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.",

Pesci first broke into entertainment as a child actor, and by the mid-1950s, was starring on the series \"Star Time Kids\". In the mid-1960s, he released a record under the stage name Joe Ritchie titled \"Little Joe Sure Can Sing\", and was also playing guitar with several bands, including Joey Dee and The Starliters. He even joined with his friend Frank Vincent to start a vaudeville-style comedy act, but met with limited success (interestingly, Pesci and Vincent would later go on to co-star in several gangster films together, including Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995).Pesci's first film role was as an uncredited dancer in Hey, Let's Twist! (1961) and then he had to wait another 15 years for a minor role in The Death Collector (1976). His work in the second film was seen by Robert De Niro, who convinced director Martin Scorsese to cast him as Joey LaMotta in the epic boxing film Raging Bull (1980), which really got him noticed in Hollywood. He played opposite Rodney Dangerfield in Easy Money (1983), was with buddy DeNiro again in Once Upon a Time in America (1984), nearly stole the show as con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) and scored a Best Supporting Actor Oscar playing the psychotic Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas (1990).His comedic talents shone again in the mega-popular Home Alone (1990), and he put in a terrific performance as co-conspirator David Ferrie in JFK (1991). Pesci was back again as Leo Getz for Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), and was still a bumbling crook in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), and had a minor role in the Robert De Niro-directed A Bronx Tale (1993). He was lured back by Scorsese to play another deranged gangster named Nicky (based on real-life hood Tony Spilotro [aka \"The Ant\"]) in the violent Casino (1995), and starred in the comedies 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag (1997) and Gone Fishin' (1997), although both failed to fire at the box office.Pesci returned again as fast-talking con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 4 (1998). In 1999, he announced his retirement from acting and since then, he appeared only occasionally in films, including a cameo appearance in The Good Shepherd (2006). He also appeared in the music documentary I Go Back Home: Jimmy Scott (2016).",

Between 1991-93, Ryan appeared in Fifteen (1990), a Nickelodeon series taped in Florida with many other Canadian actors. After the series ended, he returned to Vancouver where he played in a series of forgettable television movies. He did small roles in Glenn Close's Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story (1995) and CBS's update of In Cold Blood (1996). However, his run of luck had led him to decide to quit acting.One night, he ran into fellow Vancouver actor and native Chris William Martin. Martin found Ryan rather despondent and told him to pack everything: they were going to head to Los Angeles, California. The two stayed in a cheap Los Angeles motel. On the first night of their stay, Reynolds' jeep was rolled downhill and stripped. For the next four months, Ryan drove it without doors. In 1997, he landed the role of Berg in Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Initially, the show was reviled by critics and seemed desperate for any type of ratings success. However, it was renewed for a second season but with a provision for a makeover by former Roseanne (1988) writer Kevin Abbott. The show became a minor success and has led to additional film roles for Ryan, most notably in the last-ever MGM film, a remake of The Amityville Horror (2005). Ryan was engaged to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, another Nickelodeon veteran, between 2004-2006.He has been married to Blake Lively since September 9, 2012.

        "bio": "This remarkable, soft-spoken American began in films as a diffident juvenile. With passing years, he matured into a star character actor who exemplified not only integrity and strength, but an ideal of the common man fighting against social injustice and oppression. He was born in Grand Island, Hall, Nebraska, the son of Herberta Elma (Jaynes) and William Brace Fonda, who was a commercial printer, and proprietor of the W. B. Fonda Printing Company in Omaha, Nebraska. His distant ancestors were Italians who had fled their country and moved to Holland, presumably because of political or religious persecution. In the mid-1600s, they crossed the Atlantic and settled in upstate New York where they founded a community with the Fonda name.Growing up, Henry developed an early interest in journalism after having a story published in a local newspaper. At the age of twelve, he helped in his father's printing business for $2 a week. Following graduation from high school in 1923, he got a part-time job in Minneapolis with the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company which allowed him at first to pursue journalistic studies at the University of Minnesota. As it became difficult to juggle his working hours with his academic roster, he obtained another position as a physical education instructor at $30 a week, including room and board. By this time, he had grown to a height of six foot one and was a natural for basketball.In 1925, having returned to Omaha, Henry reevaluated his options and came to the conclusion that journalism was not his forte, after all. For a while, he tried his hand at several temporary jobs, including as a mechanic and a window dresser. Then, despite opposition from his parents, Henry accepted an offer from Gregory Foley, director of the Omaha Playhouse, to play the title role in 'Merton of the Movies'. His father would not speak to him for a month. The play and its star received fairly good notices in the local press. It ran for a week, after which Henry observed \"the idea of being Merton and not myself taught me that I could hide behind a mask\". For the rest of the repertory season, Henry advanced to assistant director which enabled him to design and paint sets as well as act. A casual trip to New York, however, had already made him set his sights on Broadway.In 1928, he headed east and briefly played in summer stock before joining the University Players, a group of talented Princeton and Harvard graduates among whose number were such future luminaries as James Stewart (who would remain his closest lifelong friend), Joshua Logan and Kent Smith. Before long, Henry played leads opposite Margaret Sullavan, soon to become the first of his five wives. Both marriage and the players broke up four years later. In 1932, Henry found himself sharing a two-room New York apartment with Jimmy Stewart and Joshua Logan. For the next two years, he alternated scenic design with acting at various repertory companies. In 1934, he got a break of sorts, when he was given the chance to present a comedy sketch with Imogene Coca in the Broadway revue New Faces. That year, he also hired Leland Hayward as his personal management agent and this was to pay off handsomely.It was Hayward who persuaded the 29-year old to become a motion picture actor, despite initial misgivings and reluctance on Henry's part. Independent producer Walter Wanger, whose growing stock company was birthed at United Artists, needed a star for The Farmer Takes a Wife (1935). With both first choice actors Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea otherwise engaged, Henry was the next available option. After all, he had just completed a successful run on Broadway in the stage version. The cheesy publicity tag line for the picture was \"you'll be fonder of Fonda\", but the film was an undeniable hit. Wanger, realizing he had a good thing going, next cast Henry in a succession of A-grade pictures which capitalized on his image as the sincere, unaffected country boy. Pick of the bunch were the Technicolor outdoor western The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936), the gritty Depression-era drama You Only Live Once (1937) (with Henry as a back-to-the-wall good guy forced into becoming a fugitive from the law by circumstance), the screwball comedy The Moon's Our Home (1936) (with ex-wife Sullavan), the excellent pre-civil war-era romantic drama Jezebel (1938) and the equally superb Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), in which Henry gave his best screen performance to date as the 'jackleg lawyer from Springfield'. Henry made two more films with director John Ford: the pioneering drama Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and The Grapes of Wrath (1940), with Henry as Tom Joad, often regarded his career-defining role as the archetypal grassroots American trying to stand up against oppression. It also set the tone for his subsequent career. Whether he played a lawman (Wyatt Earp in My Darling Clementine (1946)), a reluctant posse member (The Ox-Bow Incident (1942), a juror committed to the ideal of total justice in (12 Angry Men (1957)) or a nightclub musician wrongly accused of murder (The Wrong Man (1956)), his characters were alike in projecting integrity and quiet authority. In this vein, he also gave a totally convincing (though historically inaccurate) portrayal in the titular role of The Return of Frank James (1940), a rare example of a sequel improving upon the original.Henry rarely featured in comedy, except for a couple of good turns opposite Barbara Stanwyck -- with whom he shared an excellent on-screen chemistry -- in The Mad Miss Manton (1938) and The Lady Eve (1941). He was also good value as a poker-playing grifter in the western comedy A Big Hand for the Little Lady (1966). Finally, just to confound those who would typecast him, he gave a chilling performance as one of the coldest, meanest stone killers ever to roam the West, in Sergio Leone's classic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Illness curtailed his work in the 1970s. His final screen role was as an octogenarian in On Golden Pond (1981), in which he was joined by his daughter Jane. It finally won him an Oscar on the heels of an earlier Honorary Academy Award. Too ill to attend the ceremony, he died soon after at the age of 77, having left a lasting legacy matched by few of his peers.",

Recently, he did a turn in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth,\" where as the principal lead, he so transfixed the audience that the show was extended in London and critically acclaimed. Bean, however, remains himself, a man's man, and in the glitzy world of movies this is a rare thing indeed.

        "bio": "Willard Carroll \"Will\" Smith II (born September 25, 1968) is an American actor, comedian, producer, rapper, and songwriter. He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him \"the most powerful actor in Hollywood\". Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.Smith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.Smith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.Smith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he \"wanted to rap.\" Smith says he was admitted to a \"pre-engineering [summer] program\" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, \"My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college.\"Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey \"DJ Jazzy Jeff\" Townes as producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably \"Parents Just Don't Understand\" and \"Summertime\". They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming \"the biggest movie star in the world\", studying box office successes' common characteristics.\nSmith's first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he \"made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better.\"In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be \"aggressively unique\". A reviewer said that the film's commercial success \"cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood.\" On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.In 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa. It was in 2008 that Smith starred in the superhero movie Hancock.Men in Black III opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years.On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game. Smith's most recent studio album, Lost and Found, was released in 2005.Smith and his son Jaden played father and son in two productions: the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of Happyness, and the science fiction film After Earth, which was released on May 31, 2013.Smith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama Focus.

        "bio": "In both career and in real life, Bobby Cannavale tends to choose the unconventional way of doing things. In the beginning, his decisions may have cost the dark, swarthily good-looking actor some acting roles and/or good-paying parts but, in the end, his strong work ethic and sense of self, despite a lack of formal training, allowed him to take a successful path off the crowded acting trail. From character goofball and cut-up, he has broken into the leading man ranks with his recent starring role as a reincarnated matchmaker in the TV series Cupid (2009).Born Roberto M. Cannavale on May 3, 1971, in Union City, New Jersey, to an Italian-American father, Sal, and a Cuban mother, Isabel, he was involved in various activities at his Union City Catholic school, St. Michaels, while growing up. An altar boy, choir boy and lector, he also appeared in the church school's various musicals including his very first, \"Guys and Dolls\", in which he showed up as one of the gangsters, and \"The Music Man\", appearing as the lisping, scene-stealing tyke, \"Winthrop\".Bobby's parents divorced when he was five years old and his mother moved the family to Puerto Rico for a couple of years. Eventually, they returned to the States and settled in Coconut Creek, Florida, where he attended high school. Restless and uncomfortable in any sort of regimented setting, he often got suspended for playing the class clown. Graduating in the late 1980s, and bitten by the acting bug, Bobby chose to return to the New York/New Jersey area in order to jump start an acting career. Working in bars to support himself, he again avoided the confines of an acting school and, instead, gained experience as a \"reader\" on occasion with the Naked Angels theatre company. During this time (1994), he met and married Jenny Lumet, the actress-daughter of director Sidney Lumet. They had son, Jake, the following year. The couple divorced in 2003.Spotted by playwright Lanford Wilson while performing in an East Village production of Larry Kramer's \"The Normal Heart\", Bobby was invited to join Wilson's prestigious Circle Repertory Theatre. As a \"reader\" for the company, he eventually earned stage parts in \"Chilean Holidays\" (1996) and in Wilson's \"Virgil Is Still the Frog Boy.\" He also went on to serve as understudy to Mark Linn-Baker in a 1998 production of \"A Flea in Her Ear\" and later replaced him. A noticeable role in the company's play, \"The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told\" by Paul Rudnick led to Bobby's being cast in the recurring role of a tugboat operator in the TV series Trinity (1998). Having only appeared in bit parts thus far in such movies as Night Falls on Manhattan (1996), directed by Lumet, and I'm Not Rappaport (1996), it was \"Trinity\" creator John Wells who caught Bobby's stage performance and handed him this career-making break on camera.Bobby's \"nice-guy\" aura and blue-collar charm proved invaluable, if a bit restrictive. Once the \"Trinity\" series ended, Wells cast the 6'3\" lug with the trademark caterpillar brows and crooked smile as lovelorn paramedic \"Bobby Caffey\" in his series Third Watch (1999). The character became quite popular but Bobby, again feeling restricted and wishing to broaden his horizon as an actor, asked to be released from the show -- but \"in a big way\". Creator Wells obliged and had the paramedic fatally shot in the chest and then experience a \"beyond the grave\" union with his character's deceased, ne'er-do-well dad.Bobby next joined the cast of father-in-law Sidney Lumet's acclaimed TV courtroom drama 100 Centre Street (2001), starring Alan Arkin, cast against type as a brazenly opportunistic prosecutor. He subsequently earned recurring roles on Ally McBeal (1997) (in 2002) and Six Feet Under (2001) (in 2004). As for films, Bobby was featured in Gloria (1999), The Bone Collector (1999), Washington Heights (2002) and The Guru (2002) by the time he scored as the gregarious food truck driver in the critically-hailed indie film The Station Agent (2003), which paired him intriguingly opposite the diminutive actor Peter Dinklage.Unwilling to shirk away from more controversial roles such as his gay drug dealer who has the hots for a fellow prisoner in the acclaimed series Oz (1997) or his closeted dancing neophyte in the film comedy Shall We Dance? (2004) starring Richard Gere, Bobby continued to elevate his status seesawing between film (Shortcut to Happiness (2003), Happy Endings (2005), Romance & Cigarettes (2005)) and TV assignments (the miniseries Kingpin (2003)). He earned big viewer points and an Emmy Award for his recurring portrayal of Will's dour cop/boyfriend on the hit sitcom Will & Grace (1998) in 2004. Elsewhere, on stage, he merited attention in such productions as \"Hurlyburly\" and earned a Tony Award nomination for his 2007 Broadway debut in \"Mauritius.\"After five consecutive failed pilots, Bobby has come front-and-center with his quirky starring role in the ABC series Cupid (2009), plus recurring roles in Cold Case (2003) and Nurse Jackie (2009), and his second Emmy-winning part in Boardwalk Empire (2010). He continues to rake up credits on the big screen with (The Merry Gentleman (2008), Diminished Capacity (2008), The Take (2007), 100 Feet (2008), Roadie (2011), Blue Jasmine (2013), link=tt2883512], Ant-Man (2015), I, Tonya (2017), Boundaries (2018) and The Irishman (2019), and with fascinating continuing/regular roles on such TV series as Cupid (2009), Cold Case (2003), Boardwalk Empire (2010), Nurse Jackie (2009), Vinyl (2016), Mr. Robot (2015) and Homecoming (2018), this dark, brutish character has plenty of staying power in both comedy and drama.",

Richard was among the first and most\nsuccessful talents to emerge during the American independent film\nrenaissance of the 1990s. Typically setting each of his movies during\none 24-hour period, Linklater's work explored what he dubbed \"the youth\nrebellion continuum,\" focusing in fine detail on generational rites and\nmores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively\ncapturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of\nnuanced, illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of\ntalented young actors into the Hollywood firmament. Born in Houston,\nTexas, Linklater suspended his educational career at Sam Houston State\nUniversity in 1982, to work on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of\nMexico. He subsequently relocated to the state's capital of Austin,\nwhere he founded a film society and began work on his debut film,\n1987's It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books (1988).

        "bio": "Guy Ritchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK on September 10, 1968. After watching Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) as a child, Guy realized that what he wanted to do was make films. He never attended film school, saying that the work of film school graduates was boring and unwatchable. At 15 years old, he dropped out of school and in 1995, got a job as a runner, ultimately starting his film career. He quickly progressed and was directing music promos for bands and commercials by 1995.The profits that he made from directing these promos was invested into writing and making the film The Hard Case (1995), a 20-minute short film that is also the prequel to his debut feature Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). Sting's wife, Trudie Styler, saw The Hard Case (1995) and invested in the feature film. Once completed, 10 British distributors turned the film down before it eventually was released in the UK in 1998 and in the US in 1999; the film put Ritchie on the map as one of the hottest rising filmmakers of the time, and launched the careers of actors Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, and Vinnie Jones, among others.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) was followed by Snatch (2000), this time with a bigger budget and a few more familiar faces such as Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Benicio Del Toro alongside returning actors Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Jason Flemyng. At the end of 2000, Ritchie married the pop superstar Madonna in Scotland, and proceeded to work with his famous wife on a variety of film and video projects, including the short Star (2001), made for BMW and co-starring Clive Owen, and the controversial video \"What It Feels Like for a Girl,\" which was called out for its violence. In 2002, the couple embarked on a remake of the 1974 Lina Wertmüller film Swept Away (2002); the new film was a critical and commercial flop, winning five Razzie Awards. Ritchie followed up with the Vegas heist film Revolver (2005), which was panned, but won favor with the crime thriller RocknRolla (2008), which featured a game, energetic cast and brought American attention to rising stars Gerard Butler and Tom Hardy.The next year saw the release of Sherlock Holmes (2009), starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role and Jude Law as his cohort Dr. Watson. The film received mostly good reviews but, more important for Ritchie's career, was a solid blockbuster hit that grossed more than $520 million dollars worldwide and spawned a sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Ritchie is tentatively scheduled to direct an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island.Ritchie has two sons with Madonna: Rocco, born in 2000, and an adopted son, David, born in 2005. In late 2008, the couple confirmed reports that they were splitting up, and agreed to a divorce settlement that was finalized in December of that year. In September 2011, Ritchie's girlfriend, model Jacqui Ainsley, gave birth to a son, Rafael, and in July 2012 the couple announced they were expecting their second child.",

        "bio": "Scott Glenn was born January 26, 1939, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Hope Elizabeth and Theodore Glenn, a salesman. As he grew up in Appalachia, his health was poor; he was bedridden for a year and doctors predicted he would limp for the rest of his life. During long periods of illness, Glenn was reading a lot and \"dreaming of becoming Lord Byron\". He challenged his illness by intense training programs and eventually got rid of his limp.After graduating high school, Glenn entered William and Mary College where he majored in English. He spent three years in the Marines and then tried to combine his passion for storytelling with his passion for adventures by working for five months as a criminal reporter at the Kenosha Evening News. Glenn planned to become an author but found out he had \"problems with dialogues\", so he decided to overcome it by studying acting. In 1966, he headed to New York where he joined George Morrison acting class. He helped in directing student plays to pay for his studies and appeared onstage in La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club productions. Soon after arriving in New York, Glenn became a fan of martial arts. In 1968, he joined The Actors Studio and began working in professional theater and TV. In 1970, James Bridges offered him his first movie work in The Baby Maker (1970).Glenn left for L.A., where he spent seven of the \"most miserable years of [his] life\". He couldn't find interesting film roles and, doing brief TV stints, he felt \"like a person who had to paint the Sistine Chapel with a house-painter's brush\". On a brighter side, he worked episodically with Jonathan Demme (Angels Hard as They Come (1971), Fighting Mad (1976)), Robert Altman (Nashville (1975)) and Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse Now (1979)). In 1978, Glenn got tired of Hollywood and moved his family to Ketchum, Idaho, where he worked as a barman, huntsman and mountain ranger for two years (occasionally acting in Seattle stage productions). James Bridges once more changed the course of Glenn's life in 1980 when he offered him the role of John Travolta's rival in Urban Cowboy (1980) and made him a star. Glenn's acting abilities and physical presence helped him to excel both in action (Silverado (1985), The Challenge (1982)) and drama (The Right Stuff (1983), Countdown to Looking Glass (1984), The River (1984)) as he alternately played good guys and bad guys.In the beginning of the '90s, his career was at its peak - he appeared in such indisputable masterpieces as The Silence of the Lambs (1991), and The Hunt for Red October (1990). Established as one of Hollywood's most solid and respected character actors he has appeared in a wide variety of films, such as the black Freudian farce Reckless (1995), the tragicomedy Edie & Pen (1996) and Ken Loach's socio-political declaration Carla's Song (1996), alternating mainstream (Courage Under Fire (1996), Absolute Power (1997)) with independent projects (Lesser Prophets (1997) and Larga distancia (1997)), written by his daughter Dakota Glenn), and TV (Naked City: A Killer Christmas (1998)). Continuing into the 21st century, Glenn has also appeared in Training Day (2001), W. (2008) (as Donald Rumsfeld), Secretariat (2010), Sucker Punch (2011), The Paperboy (2012), and two of the Bourne films: The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Bourne Legacy (2012).",

Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Dazed and Confused (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger.Shortly thereafter, moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham's novel A Time to Kill (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry's hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space\nscience Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg's Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew's birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998).In 1999, he starred in the comedy Edtv (1999), about the rise of reality television, and in 2000, he headlined Jonathan Mostow's U-571 (2000), portraying officer Lt. Tyler, in a WW II story of the daring mission of American submariners trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine.In the 2000s, he became known for starring in romantic comedies, such as The Wedding Planner (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez, and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003), in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Reign of Fire (2002), where he co-starred with Christian Bale. In 2006, he starred in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006), and later as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006), along with Matthew Fox. In 2008, he played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Fool's Gold (2008), again with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009), co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a two year hiatus to open different opportunities in his career. Since 2010, he has moved away from romantic comedies.That change came in 2011, in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), reporter Ward Jensen in The Paperboy (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012), starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey's career certainly reached it's prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club (2013), shot in less than a month. For his portrayal of Ron, Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor, among other awards and nominations. The same year, he also appeared in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). In 2014, he starred in HBO's True Detective (2014), as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards; he also won a Critics' Choice Award for the role.Also in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.",

        "bio": "Born on October 1, 1921, in White Plains, New York, gruff veteran\ncharacter actor James Whitmore earned early and widespread respect with\nhis award-winning dramatic capabilities on Broadway and in films. He\nwould later conquer TV with the same trophy-winning results.The son of James Allen Whitmore and Florence Crane, he was educated at\nConnecticut's Choate School after receiving a football scholarship. He\nlater earned his BA from Yale University in 1944 before serving with\nthe Marines in World War II. Following his honorable discharge he\nprepared for the stage under the G.I. bill at the American Theatre\nWing, where he met first wife Nancy Mygatt. They married in 1947 and\nwent on to have three sons together -- Steve, Dan and actor/director\nJames Whitmore Jr..Applause and kudos came swiftly for Whitmore while under both the\nBroadway and film banners. After appearing with the Peterborough, New\nHampshire, Players in the summer of 1947 in \"The Milky Way,\" Whitmore\nmade a celebrated Broadway debut as Tech Sergeant Evans in \"Command\nDecision\" later that year. His gritty performance swept the stage\nacting trifecta -- Tony, Donaldson and Theatre World awards. In later\nyears Whitmore would often comment that most of his satisfaction came\nfrom performing on the live stage.Hollywood soon took notice of Whitmore.\nClark Gable happened to be starring in the\nfilm version of\nCommand Decision (1948), and it\nwas hoped that Whitmore would get to recreate his award-winning role.\nBut it was not to be. Song-and-dance star\nVan Johnson, who was looking for\nstraight, serious roles after a vastly successful musical career, was\ngiven the coveted part. The disappointment didn't last long, however,\nand Whitmore made an auspicious film bow the following year with a\nprime role in the documentary-styled crime thriller\nThe Undercover Man (1949)\nstarring Glenn Ford and\nNina Foch. Whitmore scored brilliantly with\nhis second film as well.\nBattleground (1949), another war\npicture, was highly praised and the actor became the talk of the town\nupon its initial release, grabbing both the Golden Globe and an Oscar\nnomination for \"supporting actor\" for his efforts.Hardly the handsome, matinée lead type, Whitmore nevertheless primed\nhimself up for leading roles in a character vein and found a fine range\nof material come his way. He showed off his soft inner core as a\nreligious, moral-minded family man opposite\nNancy Reagan [Reagan] in the\ninspirational drama\nThe Next Voice You Hear... (1950);\nfeatured his usual saltier side alongside\nMarjorie Main in\nMrs. O'Malley and Mr. Malone (1950);\nably portrayed a hunchbacked crook in\nThe Asphalt Jungle (1950) and\ndisplayed customary authority as a security chief in the stoic military\ndrama Above and Beyond (1952)\nstarring Robert Taylor. Elsewhere,\nhe played it strictly for laughs as a Runyonesque gangster partnered\nwith Keenan Wynn in the classic MGM musical\nKiss Me Kate (1953); portrayed a\nvaliant cop fighting off gigantic mutant ants in the intelligent sci-fi\nthriller Them! (1954); a hard-hitting\nsocial worker in\nCrime in the Streets (1956)\nand even made the most of his small role as\nTyrone Power's manager in\nThe Eddy Duchin Story (1956).By 1959, the craggy-faced actor known for his trademark caterpillar\neyebrows, turned more and more toward the small screen, with memorable\nroles in\nThe Twilight Zone (1959),\nThe Detectives (1959) (working\nagain with Robert Taylor),\nBen Casey (1961) and a host of live\ntheater dramas. He also starred in his own series as attorney Abraham\nLincoln Jones in\nThe Law and Mr. Jones (1960),\nwhich lasted two seasons.Every so often a marvelous character would rear its pretty head and\ninterest him back to the big screen. Notable of these were his white\nman passing for black in the controversial social drama\nBlack Like Me (1964); his weary\nveteran cop in Madigan (1968); and his\nbrash, authoritative simian in the classic sci-fi\nPlanet of the Apes (1968).Divorced from wife Nancy after more than two decades, Whitmore married\nactress Audra Lindley, best known on TV as\nMrs. Roper of\nThree's Company (1976) fame,\nin 1972. The couple forged a strong acting partnership as well,\nparticularly on stage, and maintained a professional relationship long\nafter their 1979 divorce. Whitmore and Lindley were lauded for their\nappearances together in such plays as \"The Magnificent Yankee,\" \"On\nGolden Pond,\" \"The Visit,\" \"Foxfire\" and \"Love Letters,\" among others.In the 1970s the actor transformed into a magnificent one-man-show\nmachine playing such celebrated and inspiring historical/entertainment\nicons as Will Rogers,\nHarry Truman and\nTheodore Roosevelt. He disappeared\ninto these historical legends so efficiently that even the\npowers-that-be had the good sense to preserve them on film and TV in\nthe form of\nWill Rogers' USA (1972);\nGive 'em Hell, Harry! (1975),\nwhich earned him his second Oscar nomination; and\nBully: An Adventure with Teddy Roosevelt (1978).In his twilight years, Whitmore showed he still had what it took to\ntouch movie audiences, most notably as the fragile\nprisoner-turned-parolee who cannot adapt to his late-life freedom in\nthe classic film\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1994).\nOn TV he continued to win awards, copping a TV Emmy for a recurring\npart on The Practice (1997) in\nthe late 1990s. A household face in commercials as well, one of his\npassions was gardening and he eventually became the spokesman for\nMiracle-Gro plant food.Whitmore remarried (and re-divorced, 1979-1981) his first wife Nancy\nbriefly before finding a lasting union with his fourth wife,\nactress-turned-author Noreen Nash, whom he\nmarried broaching age 80 in 2001. Whitmore died of lung cancer on\nFebruary 6, 2009, after having been diagnosed in mid-November 2008.",

He attended boarding school in neighboring town, Krugersdorp, and with the help of an encouraging teacher booked his first television acting gig in \"Meester\" (The Master) in 1989.Sandilands received his bachelor's degree in Social Sciences from the Rand Afrikaans University (1996). He also received an honorary award for his contribution to Arts & Culture from the University, having won its Theatre Festival three years consecutively, with plays that he had written and starred in. He also initiated an International Film Festival.July 2022 saw Neil Sandilands being nominated as best supporting actor by the South African Film and Television Awards (SAFTA) for his work in DAM (Showmax) as well as a South African Music Award (SAMA) for best adult contemporary Afrikaans album for his debut album \"Sangoma Sandilands & Jou Pa se Posse - Maanskyn\". The music of this album also featured as the soundtrack for M-Net Originals 2022 hit show \"Desert Rose\" in which Sandilands portrays the troubled patriarch \"Freddy Fingers\". Sandilands sports local South African Nr1 Radio positions for his Afrikaans tracks \"Woestynroos\" and \"Huistoe\".By 2000 Sandilands was a household name in South Africa. He is well known for his portrayal of \"Bart Kruger\" in the South African soap opera \"7de Laan.\" However, Sandilands had his sights on an international career, and has made the transition seamlessly. Sandilands crossed the international divide in 2003 with the arthouse film \"Proteus\" by Canadian director John Greyson. While Sandilands can be seen appearing in projects with a global reach, he still works often in South Africa where he performs in his native tongue, Afrikaans (English is his second language).As a musician Sandilands released two full length albums and two EP's. His debut album \"Sangoma Sandilands & Jou Pa se Posse - Maanskyn\" (2021), in his native tongue, Afrikaans, leaped to Number 1 on iTunes South Africa's charts in 24 hours. In 2023 he released \"Allegaarkie vir 'n Askeet\", his second album. Sandilands views his \"work\" as musician more as an artistic, literary offering to his country of birth and his native tongue, Afrikaans. It remains his hobby. He collaborated with the cream of South African musicians to produce these albums; writing, composing, performing lead vocals and playing the ukulele.Accolades for Sandilands include being a recipient of the South African Academy of Arts and Sciences award for his directorial work on \"Impresario\" - a 21-episode documentary. In 2014 he received a Clio, also as a documentary director. As an actor he has received numerous nominations and awards. Notably a \"Fleur du Cap\" for his work in theatre.Sandilands played rugby in South Africa, America, England, Wales and Ireland, and regards the South African Rugby World Cup victory in 2023, for the 4th time, a miraculous anomaly. He enjoys fishing and cites his philosophical development as being most influenced by Camus, Wittgenstein, Deleuze and Nietzsche, in reverse order. He would love to portray Nietzsche or the character Meursault from Camus' \"L'Étranger\".Sandilands splits his time between South Africa, and Los Angeles, California. He is represented by Stewart Talent and managed by Luber Roklin Entertainment (USA). In South Africa he is represented by Figjam Artists Agency.Henry Mylne (director) writes: \"Vivid, flamboyant (and) thoroughly professional, he doubtlessly brings an electric excitement to both stage and screen that few actors can match.\" neilsandilands.com @realsandilands",

        "bio": "Rugged features and a natural charm have worked for Josh Brolin, the son of actor James Brolin. He has played roles as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States.Brolin was born February 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, California, to Jane Cameron (Agee), a Texas-born wildlife activist, and James Brolin. Josh was not interested at first in the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However,\nduring junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like. He played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film The Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Pilot (1987) and The Young Riders (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, James Brolin.After The Young Riders (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in The Road Killers (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Gang in Blue (1996), the romantic film Bed of Roses (1996), the thriller film Nightwatch (1997), and appeared with his father in My Brother's War (1997).\nHowever, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop The Mod Squad (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn (2000), the sci-if thriller Hollow Man (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane but later divorced in 2013.It was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Grindhouse (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: corrupt officer Nick Trupo in the crime epic American Gangster (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama In the Valley of Elah (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in No Country for Old Men (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.Brolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film Milk (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W. (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W. (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially.Brolin then acted in the smaller comedy Women in Trouble (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin's character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film's chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen's London-based film You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of True Grit (1969).Despite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly. Hopefully, he continues this streak of good fortune that his talents have finally given him.",

The talented young boy, inspired by Star Wars to try acting, got\nhis first taste of it in his school's production of Oliver Twist when\nhe was 10. Boyd's parents were extremely supportive, driving over two\nhours to get him to the performances, but sadly they passed away when\nhe was 12. He was thereafter raised by his grandmother. He realized\nthat he enjoyed acting very much and told his school counselor that was\nwhat he wanted to be, but the counselor discouraged this choice and\ntold him to \"keep it secret\". When he was 17 he left school and went to\nwork in a book-binding workshop. He worked there 4 years as an\napprentice and 2 years as a workman. Ironically, during the years he\nworked at the book-binders, the Lord of the Rings trilogy was printed\nand bound there, many copies bound by his hands. After the 6 years as a\nbook-binder, he was thoroughly sick of it. Billy planned on going to\nAmerica for a year, but before he went he called the Royal Scottish\nAcademy of Music and Drama and asked about applying for when he got\nback. But it so happened that they still had space for that year and\nthey asked him if he wanted to apply and he did. He was at the drama\nschool in a 3-year course for his bachelor of arts degree, meanwhile\nstudying everything from Shakespeare to puppet-making. During this time\nBilly had a few small roles in TV series such as \"Down Amongst The\nBoys\" and \"Taggart\". After graduating he performed in many plays like\n'The Slab Boys', 'The Diary of Adrian Mole' etc. at The St. Andrews\ntheatre which were his first paying roles. He then received a call from\nhis agent about the Lord of the Rings movies and if he would like to\naudition for them. He went along not expecting much, but within a few\nmonths Peter Jackson came out to Scotland to meet him and to audition\nhim personally. While rehearsing for a show he received a call from his\nagent who said that the part of Pippin had been offered to him - if he\nwanted it. The rest is history.",

        "bio": "Strikingly featured and muscular American actor Ving Rhames was born Irving Rameses Rhames in Harlem, New York, to Reather, a homemaker, and Ernest Rhames, an auto mechanic. A good student, Ving entered the New York High\nSchool of Performing Arts, where he discovered his love of acting. He\nstudied at the Juilliard School of Drama, and began his career in New\nYork theater and in Shakespeare in the Park productions. He first appeared on Broadway in the play \"The Winter\nBoys\", in 1984. Also that year, he appeared in front of the cameras for the first time in the TV movie Go Tell It on the Mountain (1985), and was then quickly cast in minor roles in several popular TV shows, including Miami Vice (1984), Tour of Duty (1987) and Crime Story (1986). Ving continued his rise to fame through his work in soap\noperas.His big break came in 1994 when Quentin Tarantino cast him as the merciless drug dealer Marsellus Wallace in the mega hit Pulp Fiction (1994). Not long after, director Brian De Palma cast Rhames alongside Tom Cruise as the ace computer hacker Luther Stickell in Mission: Impossible (1996). With solid performances in both these highly popular productions, his face was now well known to moviegoers and the work offers began rolling in more frequently. His next career highlight was playing the lead role in the HBO production of Don King: Only in America (1997). Rhames' performance as the world's most infamous boxing promoter was nothing short of brilliant, and at the 1998 Golden Globe Awards he picked up the award for Best Actor in a Miniseries. However, in an incredible display of compassion, he handed over the award to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon, as he felt Lemmon was a more deserving winner. Rhames then made an attention-grabbing performance in Bringing Out the Dead (1999), reprised his role as Luther Stickell in Mission: Impossible II (2000), contributed his deep bass voice for the character of Cobra Bubbles in Lilo & Stitch (2002), and played a burly cop fighting cannibal zombie hordes in Dawn of the Dead (2004). A keen fitness and weightlifting enthusiast, Rhames is also well known for his strong spiritual beliefs and benevolent attitude towards other people.In a remarkable turn of events whilst filming The Saint of Fort Washington (1993) in New York, he was introduced to a homeless man who turned out to be his long-lost older brother, Junior, who had lost contact with the family after serving in Vietnam. The thrilled Rhames immediately assisted his disheveled brother in getting proper food and clothing and moved him into his own apartment.",

        "bio": "A masculine and enigmatic actor whose life and movie career have had more ups and downs than the average rollercoaster and whose selection of roles has arguably derailed him from achieving true superstar status, James Caan is New York-born and bred.He was born in the Bronx, to Sophie (Falkenstein) and Arthur Caan, Jewish immigrants from Germany. His father was a meat dealer and butcher. The athletically gifted Caan played football at Michigan State University while studying economics, holds a black belt in karate and for several years was even a regular on the rodeo circuit, where he was nicknamed \"The Jewish Cowboy\". However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's\nNeighborhood Playhouse. He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in\nseveral off-Broadway productions, including \"I Roam\" and \"Mandingo\".He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce (1963) and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 (1965) and the\nwestern El Dorado (1966) alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum. Further work followed in Journey to Shiloh (1968) and in\nthe sensitive The Rain People (1969). However, audiences were moved to tears as he put in a heart-rending performance as cancer-stricken Chicago Bears running back Brian Piccolo in the highly rated made-for-TV film Brian's Song (1971).With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino \"Sonny\" Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather (1972). The film was an enormous success, Caan scored a Best Supporting Actor nomination\nand, in the years since, the role has proven to be the one most fondly remembered by his legion of fans. He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. These included a\ncop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in the uneven Freebie and the Bean (1974), a superb performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler (1974) alongside Lauren Hutton, and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady (1975). Two further strong\nlead roles came up for him in 1975, first as futuristic sports star \"Jonathon E\" questioning the moral fiber of a sterile society in\nRollerball (1975) and teaming up with Robert Duvall in the Sam Peckinpah spy thriller The Killer Elite (1975).Unfortunately, Caan's rising star sputtered badly at this stage of his career, and several film projects failed to find fire with either\ncritics or audiences. These included such failures as the hokey Harry and Walter Go to New York (1976), the quasi-western Comes a Horseman (1978) and the\nsaccharine Chapter Two (1979). However, he did score again with the stylish Michael Mann-directed heist movie Thief (1981). He followed this with a supernatural romantic comedy titled Kiss Me Goodbye (1982) and then, due to personal conflicts, dropped out of the spotlight for several years before returning with a stellar performance under old friend Francis Ford Coppola in the moving\nGardens of Stone (1987).Caan appeared back in favor with fans and critics alike and raised his visibility with the sci-fi hit Alien Nation (1988) and Dick Tracy (1990), then surprised everyone by playing a meek romance novelist held captive after a car accident by a deranged fan in the dynamic Misery (1990). The 1990s were kind to him and he notched up roles as a band leader in For the Boys (1991), another\ngangster in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), appeared in the indie hit Bottle Rocket (1996) and pursued Arnold Schwarzenegger in Eraser (1996).The demand on Caan's talents seems to have increased steadily over the past few years as he is making himself known to a new generation of fans. Recent hot onscreen roles have included The Yards (2000), City of Ghosts (2002) and Dogville (2003). In addition, he finds himself at the helm of the hit TV series Las Vegas (2003) as casino security chief \"Big Ed\" Deline. An actor of undeniably manly appeal, James Caan continued to surprise and delight audiences with his invigorating performances up until his death in July 2022 at the age of 82.",

        "bio": "Japanese character actor Takashi Shimura was one of the finest film\nactors of the 20th century and a leading member of the \"stock company\"\nof master director Akira Kurosawa. A\nnative of southern Japan, Shimura was a descendant of the samurai\nwarrior class. Following university training, he founded a theatre\ncompany, Shichigatsu-za (\"July Theatre\"). In 1930 he joined a\nprofessional company, Kindai-za (\"Modern Theatre\"). Four years later he\nsigned with the Kinema Shinko film studio. He found a niche playing\nsamurai roles for various studios, then signed a long-term contract\nwith Toho Studios in 1943. He appeared in an average of six films a\nyear for Toho over the next four decades. His greatest critical acclaim\ncame in more than 20 roles for Kurosawa, though he is almost as well\nrecognized outside Japan for his kindly doctor role in the original\n\"Godzilla\" (Godzilla (1954)). Shimura's\ntriumph was his unforgettable performance as a dying bureaucrat in\nKurosawa's Ikiru (1952). He continued to\nact steadily, in good films and bad, almost until his death,\nculminating with Kurosawa's\nKagemusha: The Shadow Warrior (1980). He is often described\nas filling the spot for Kurosawa that\nWard Bond filled for\nJohn Ford--an ever-present and\nreliable character player who consistently supplied a solidity and\nstrength to whatever film he appeared in. Shimura was definitely a finer actor than Bond, of the most versatile \"chameleons\" in the world cinema, a great artist with enormous range in sublime interpretations, from Ikiru (1952)'s\ndiffident clerk to the leader of the Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's\nSeven Samurai (1954).\nHe died in 1982, a reluctant icon of Japanese cinema.",

She was born to actor/director Okuda Eiji and celebrity Kazu Ando on 18.02.1986. Her great grandfather was prime minister Tsuyoshi. Her older sister is director Ando Momoko. She saw her father on stage at age five and decided to become an actress while in second grade. She was often ill as a child. Her disease made her dizzy, lose her balance and more throughout her childhood. Her brain would shut down. She would opt for her mother's maiden surname for her professional career. Sono Sion picked her for his film Love Exposure and gave her a major start on the big screen. She won an award as the Best Supporting Actress for her work in it at the 31st Yokohama Film Festival. Earlier her father cast her in his film Kaze No Sotogawa ('Outside The Wind') alongside her mother and sister. She has since appeared in multiple movies and serials and won several more awards. She married actor Emoto Tasuku in 2012. She had met him on a train in 2008 and had obtained her father's permission to date and marry. She was a boxer in 100 Yen Love, which was fortunate since she had practiced boxing when she was fourteen-years-old. She gave birth to her first child, a girl, in 2017. She won the award for Best Actress at the 42nd Japan Academy Prize for her work on 2018's Shoplifters. By then she was considered one of several top young actresses in Japan next to Yu Aoi, Miyazaki Aoi and perhaps Aso Kumiko. Interestingly, she had earlier decided to retire and focus on raising her child. She is a graduate of Gakushuin Women's College.",

He was born William Francis Nighy on December 12, 1949 in Caterham, Surrey, England, to Catherine Josephine (Whittaker), a psychiatric nurse from Glasgow, and Alfred Martin Nighy, who was English-born and managed a garage in Croydon.At school, he gained 'O'-levels in English Language and English Literature and enjoyed reading, particularly Ernest Hemingway. On leaving school he wanted to become a journalist but didn't have the required qualifications. He eventually went on to work as a messenger boy for the Field magazine. He stayed in Paris for a while because he wanted to write \"the great novel\", but he only managed to write the title. When he ran out of money, the British consul shipped him home.Nighy wound up training at Guildford School of Dance and Drama in London, and has since then worked consistently in film, television, and on stage.Nighy is perhaps best-known to international audiences for his memorable performance as washed-up pop singer Billy Mack in Love Actually (2003), which won him a BAFTA for best supporting actor. He has also made appearances in major franchises: he played vampire leader Viktor in Underworld (2003), Underworld: Evolution (2006) and Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009), did the performance capture and voice for Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007), and made a brief appearance as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010).Nighy's recent film credits include roles in I Capture the Castle (2003), Shaun of the Dead (2004), The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005), The Constant Gardener (2005), Notes on a Scandal (2006), Hot Fuzz (2007), Valkyrie (2008) and The Boat That Rocked (2009). He has also provided voice work for many animated movies in the past few years including Flushed Away (2006), Astro Boy (2009), Rango (2011) and Arthur Christmas (2011).With supporting turns in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), Wrath of the Titans (2012) and Total Recall (2012), 2012 was a busy year for Nighy. There are no signs of slowing down either, as he next appeared in Jack the Giant Slayer (2013), About Time (2013), and I, Frankenstein (2014).Nighy has also had an active career on the small screen, beginning with Agony (1979), and his first widely-recognized role was in 1991 mini-series The Men's Room (1991). He has also made a habit of working on television with Harry Potter director David Yates: projects together include State of Play (2003), The Young Visiters (2003), The Girl in the Café (2005) and Page Eight (2011). Nighy won a Golden Globe for his performance in Gideon's Daughter (2005).Nighy actually began his career on the stage, and has earned acclaim for his work in numerous plays including \"The Vertical Hour,\" \"Pravda\". \"A Map of the World\", Tom Stoppard's Arcadia in 1993, and David Hare's Skylight. He received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in 2001 play \"Blue/Orange.\"Bill's partner was actress Diana Quick (he asked her to marry him but she said: \"don't ask me again\"; he called her his wife because anything else would have been too difficult). They have a daughter, Mary Nighy, who is studying at university and contemplating an acting career. She has already begun to appear on TV dramas and radio programs.",

        "bio": "Veteran character actor John Marley was one of those familiar but nameless faces that television and filmgoers did not take a shine to until the late 1960s, when he had already hit middle age. Quite distinctive with his dour, craggy face, dark bushy brows and upswept silvery hair, John started life in Harlem, Manhattan, New York as Mortimer Marlieb on October 17, 1907. The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, he was a City of New York College dropout heading for trouble when he avoided his omnipresent gangland trappings by joining a theater group.His young, lackluster career was interrupted after joining the Army Signal Corps during World War II. Upon his return to civilian life, he pursued his acting interest and earned minor roles in the Broadway plays \"Skipper Next to God\" (1948), \"An Enemy of the People\" (1950), \"Gramercy Ghost\" (1951) and \"Dinosaur Wharf\" (1951). Looking for on-camera work at the same time, Marley obtained atmospheric bits (crooks, reporters, cabbies, etc.) in such post-war films as Kiss of Death (1947), The Naked City (1948), Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950) and Guilty Bystander (1950).In the mid-1950s, Marley started slowly moving up into featured roles that were often ethnic (Greek, Italian) in origin. He appeared in a number of TV anthologies such as \"Colgate Theatre,\" \"Philco Television Playhouse,\" \"Armstrong Circle Theatre,\" \"Omnibus,\" \"Goodyear Playhouse,\" \"The Alcoa Hour\" and \"Robert Montgomery Presents.\" As for film work, he seemed best suited for urban drama, earning roles in The Mob (1951), My Six Convicts (1952), The Joe Louis Story (1953), The Square Jungle (1955) and I Want to Live! (1958).Finding stronger roles on Broadway with \"The Strong Are Lonely\" (1953), \"Sing Till Tomorrow,\" Marley went on to appear in \"Compulsion\" (1957) and \"The Investigation\" (1966). In the late 1950s he became a steady, sobering presence playing both sides of the legal fence with guest parts on \"The Red Skelton Show,\" \"The Jackie Gleason Show,\" \"The Phil Silvers,\" \"Cheyenne,\" \"Peter Gunn,\" \"Rawhide,\" \"Maverick,\" \"Hawaiian Eye,\" \"The Untouchables,\" \"Sea Hunt,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"The Wild, Wild West\" and \"Peyton Place.\" He was an infrequent player, however, on films -- Pay or Die! (1960), A Child Is Waiting (1963), The Wheeler Dealers (1963), America America (1963) and as Jane Fonda's father in the comedy western Cat Ballou (1965).A stage director on the side, Marley finally earned acclaim for his starring role as a middle-aged husband who leaves his long-time wife Lynn Carlin for another woman Gena Rowlands in John Cassavetes' stark, improvisational indie Faces (1968). HIs intense, sterling work in the social drama earned him the Venice Film Festival Award for \"Best Actor.\" Thereafter he became more in demand, earning Oscar and Golden Globe support nominations as Ali MacGraw's mournful, blue-collar dad in the box-office smash Love Story (1970) and cult fame as the mouthy movie titan who becomes unexpected bedmates with a horse's head after refusing Mafia Don Marlon Brando's offer in the Oscar-winning epic The Godfather (1972). Thanks to those two pictures alone, Marley, now in his mid-60s, would become a sturdy Hollywood fixture, although none of his subsequent roles would measure up to the importance or fame of the last three pictures mentioned.Marley was seen frequently on '70s and '80s TV, including \"Kolchak: The Night Stalker,\" \"Hawaii Five-O,\" \"SCTV Network,\" \"The Incredible Hulk\" and \"Hardcastle McCormick,\" and also played Moses in the TV biblical series Greatest Heroes of the Bible (1978). On film, he found work as a sheriff who becomes victim to the murderous title vehicle in The Car (1977); a doctor in The Paris Hat (1908)'s life's drama The Greatest (1977); a father figure producer to aging stuntman Burt Reynolds in Hooper (1978); a business partner to Jack Lemmon's talent agent in Tribute (1980), for which he won a Canadian \"Genie\" Award; a blackmailing journalist in the crime thriller The Amateur (1981); and an wilderness dweller in the adventure drama Mother Lode (1982). Marley's last film, the marathon sporting drama On the Edge (1985), was released posthumously.John died on May 22, 1984, following open-heart surgery at age 76. He was survived by second wife, script supervisor Every Move You Make: Part 2 (1992) and his four children, three of them by first wife, TV actress Allergic to Macedonian Dodo Birds (1967).",

        "bio": "English film actor, director and author Andy Serkis is known for his performance capture roles comprising motion capture acting, animation and voice work for such computer-generated characters as Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy (2001-2003) and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), the eponymous King Kong in the 2005 film, Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), Captain Haddock / Sir Francis Haddock in Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin (2011) and Supreme Leader Snoke in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015). Serkis earned a Golden Globe Award nomination for his portrayal of serial killer Ian Brady in the British television film Longford (2006), and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of new wave and punk rock musician Ian Dury in the biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll (2010). In 2015, he had a small role in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Serkis has his own motion capture workshop, The Imaginarium Studios in London, which he will use for his directorial debut, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle (2018).Andrew Clement G. Serkis was born April 20, 1964, in Ruislip Manor, West London, England. He has three sisters and a brother. His father, Clement Serkis, an ethnic Armenian whose original family surname was Serkissian, was a medical doctor working abroad, in Iraq; the Serkis family spent time around the Middle East, and for the first ten years of his life, Andy traveled between Baghdad and London. His mother, Lylie (Weech), who is British-born, was busy working as a special education teacher of handicapped children, so Andy and his four siblings were raised with au pairs in the house. Young Serkis wanted to be an artist; he was fond of painting and drawing, and visualized himself working behind the scenes. He attended St. Benedict's School, a Roman Catholic School for boys at the Benedictine Abbey in London. Serkis studied visual arts at Lancaster University in the north-west of England. There, he became involved in mechanical aspects of the theatre and did stage design and set building for theatrical productions. Then, Serkis was asked to play a role in a student production, and made his stage debut in Barrie Keeffe's play, \"Gotcha\"; thereafter, he switched from stage design to acting, which was a real calling that transformed his life.Instead of going to an acting college, Serkis, in 1985, began his professional acting career at the Duke's Playhouse in Lancaster, where he was given an Equity card and performed in fourteen plays, one after another, as an apprentice of Jonathan Petherbridge. After that, he worked in touring theatre companies, doing it for no money, fueled by a sense of enthusiasm, moving to a new town every week. He has thus appeared in a host of popular plays and on almost every renowned British stage. In 1989, he appeared in a stage production of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", so beginning his long association with the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, where he would return many times, to appear in \"She Stoops to Conquer\", \"Your Home in the West\" and the \"True Nature of Love\", among other plays. In the 1990s, Serkis began to make his mark on the London stage, appearing at the Royal Court Theatre as \"The Fool\" in \"King Lear\", making his interpretation of \"The Fool\" as the woman that \"Lear\", a widower, could relate to - a man, in drag, as a Victorian musician. He also appeared as \"Potts\" in the hit play, \"Mojo\", playing in front of full houses and earning huge critical success. In 1987, Serkis made his debut on television, and he acted in several major British TV miniseries throughout the 1990s.In 1999, Andy Serkis landed the prize role of \"Gollum\" in Peter Jackson's epic film trilogy based on J.R.R. Tolkien's saga, \"The Lord of the Rings\". He spent four years in the part and received awards and nominations for his performance as \"Gollum\", a computer-generated character in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), which won 11 Oscars. \"Gollum\" was the collaborative team's effort around Serkis's work in performance capture - an art form based on CGI-assisted acting. Serkis's work was an interactive performance in a skin-tight CGI suit with markers allowing cameras to track and register 3D position for each marker. Serkis' every nuance was picked up by several cameras positioned at precisely calculated angles to allow for the software to see enough information to process the image. The images of Serkis' performances were translated into the digital format by animators at Weta Digital studio in New Zealand. There, his image was key-frame animated and then edited into the movie, Serkis did have one scene in \"The Return of the King\" showing how he originally had the ring, killing another hobbit to posses it after they found it during a fishing trip. He drew from his three cats clearing fur balls out of their throats to develop the constricted voice he produced for \"Gollum\" and \"Sméagol\", and it was also enhanced by sound editing in post-production.Serkis spent almost two years in New Zealand and away from his family, and much of 2002 and 2003 in post-production studios for large periods of time, due to complexity of the creative process of bringing the character of \"Gollum\" to the screen. Serkis had to shoot two versions for every scene; one version was with him on camera, acting with (chiefly) Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, which served both to show Wood and Astin the moves so that they could precisely interact with the movements of \"Gollum\", and to provide the CGI artists the subtleties of Gollum's physical movements and facial expressions for their manual finishing of the animated images. In the other version, he'd go the voice off-camera, as Wood and Astin repeated their movements as though \"Gollum\" were there with them; that take would be the basis for inserting the CGI Gollum used in the released movie. In post-production, Serkis was doing motion-capture wearing a skintight motion capture suit with CGI gear while acting as a virtual puppeteer redoing every single scene in the studio. Additional CGI rotomation was done by animators using the human eye instead of the computer to capture the subtleties of Serkis' performance. Serkis also used this art form in his performance as \"Kong\" in King Kong (2005), which won him a Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2005) for his unprecedented work helping to realize the main character in \"King Kong\", and a Visual Effects Society Award (2006) for Outstanding Animated Character in a Live Action Motion Picture.Apart from his line of CGI-driven characters, Serkis continued with traditional acting in several leading and supporting roles, such as his appearances as \"Richard Kneeland\" opposite Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30 (2004), and \"Alley\" opposite David Bowie in The Prestige (2006), among other film performances. On television, he starred as 'Vincent Van Gogh' in the sixth episode of Simon Schama's Power of Art (2006), the BBC2 series about artists. Serkis is billed as \"Capricorn\" in the upcoming adventure film, Inkheart (2008). At the same time, he continued the development of performance capture while expanding his career into computer games. He starred as \"King Bothan\" in the martial arts drama, Heavenly Sword (2007), a Playstation 3 title, for which he provided a basis for his in-game face and also acts as a dramatic director on the project.Andy Serkis married actress and singer Lorraine Ashbourne, and the couple have three children: daughter Ruby Serkis (born in 1998), and two sons Sonny Serkis (born in 2000) and Louis Ashbourne Serkis (born on 19 June 2004), who is now also a movie star. Away from acting, Andy Serkis is an accomplished amateur painter. Since his school years at Lancaster, being so close to the Lake District, Serkis developed his other passion in life: mountaineering. He is a pescetarian. Serkis has been active in charitable causes, such as The Hope Foundation, which provides essential life-saving medical aid for children suffering from Leukemia and children from countries devastated by war. In October 2006, he was a presenter at the first annual British Academy Video Games Awards at the Roundhouse, London. Andy Serkis lives with his family in North London, England.",

He attended Erwin Piscator's\nDramatic Workshop at the New School on the GI Bill after being\ndemobilized from the US Army Air Force after World War II.Gazzo's first major success was as a playwright. His play about drug\naddiction, \"A Hatful of Rain,\" was a success on Broadway, running for\n389 performances in 1955 and 1956 and winning\nBen Gazzara and\nAnthony Franciosa Tony award\nnominations as Best Actor and Best Featured Actor, respectively.\nHowever, his second (and what would prove to be his last) Broadway\nplay, \"The Night Circus,\" also starring Gazzara, was a flop, lasting\njust 7 performances in 1958,\"A Hatful of Rain\" was made into a successful film by Oscar-winning\ndirector Fred Zinnemann in 1957.\nFranciosa won an Oscar nomination for reprising his role in the film.\nGazzo turned to screenwriting, penning the\nElvis Presley hoses-opera\nKing Creole (1958). Eventually he\nturned back to acting, where his stocky physique and unique screech of\na voice made him a first-rate character actor by the 1970s.His biggest and best acting gig came to him when\nRichard S. Castellano refused to\nappear in\nThe Godfather Part II (1974)\ndue to a money dispute. Castellano's character Clemenza was killed off\nand Gazzo was cast as Clemenza's successor in the Corleone crime family\nin New York. Gazzo was outstanding as the old-fashioned,\nunsophisticated mafioso who, believing he has been betrayed and marked\nfor death by his don, turns state's evidence against him, only to honor\nthe Mafia code of \"omerta\" in the end. Gazzo won a Best Supporting\nActor Oscar nod for his performance.Gazzo continued to work in films until his death, mostly assaying Mafia\nbosses and other criminal types. On film, though, he was able to break\nout of typecasting in his frequent television appearances and play good\nguys. He died of a stroke on February 14, 1995 in Los Angeles, at the age of 71.",

        "bio": "Character actress Beulah Bondi was a favorite of directors and\naudiences and is one of the reasons so many films from the 1930s and\n1940s remain so enjoyable, as she was an integral part of many of the\nensemble casts (a hallmark of the studio system) of major and/or great\nfilms, including\nThe Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936),\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939),\nOur Town (1940) and\nPenny Serenade (1941). Highly\nrespected as a first-tier character actress, Bondi won two Best\nSupporting Actress Oscar nominations, for\nThe Gorgeous Hussy (1936)\nand Of Human Hearts (1938), and\nan Emmy Award in 1976 for her turn in the television program\nThe Waltons (1972).She was born Beulah Bondy on May 3, 1888, in Chicago, and established\nherself as a stage actress in the first phase of her career. She made\nher Broadway debut in Kenneth S. Webb's\n\"One of the Family\" at the 49th Street Theatre on December 21, 1925.\nThe show was a modest hit, racking up 238 performances. She next\nappeared in another hit,\nMaxwell Anderson's \"Saturday's\nChildren,\" which ran for 326 performances, before appearing in her\nfirst flop, Clemence Dane's \"Mariners\" in\n1927. Philip Barry's and\nElmer Rice's \"Cock Robin\" was an extremely\nmodest hit in 1928, reaching the century mark (100 performances), but\nit was Bondi's performance in Rice's \"Street Scene,\" which opened at\nthe Playhouse Theatre on Jamuary 10, 1929, that made her career. This\nfamous play won Rice the 1929 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and was a big\nhit, playing for 601 performances. Most importantly, though, it brought\nBondi to the movies at the advanced age of 43. She made her motion\npicture debut in 1931 in the movie adaptation\n(Street Scene (1931)), recreating\nthe role she had originated on the Broadway stage. The talkies were\nstill new, and she had the talent and the voice to thrive in Hollywood.Bondi appeared in four more Broadway plays from 1931 to 1934, only one\nof which, \"The Late Christopher Bean\", a comedy by\nSidney Howard, was a hit. Her last\nappearance on Broadway for a generation was in a flop staged by\nMelvyn Douglas, \"Mother Lode\" (she made\ntwo more appearances on the Great White Way, in \"Hilda Crane\" (1950)\nand \"On Borrowed Time\" in 1953; neither was a success). For the rest of\nher professional life, her career lay primarily in film and television.She was typecast as mothers and, later, grandmothers, and played\nJames Stewart's mother four times,\nmost famously as \"Ma Bailey\" in\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946).\nHer greatest role is considered her turn in\nLeo McCarey's Depression-era melodrama\nMake Way for Tomorrow (1937),\nin which she played a mother abandoned by her children.Beulah Bondi died on January 1, 1981, from complications from an\naccident, when she broke her ribs after falling over her cat.

        "bio": "Marlon Brando is widely considered the greatest movie actor of all\ntime, rivaled only by the more theatrically oriented\nLaurence Olivier in terms of esteem.\nUnlike Olivier, who preferred the stage to the screen, Brando\nconcentrated his talents on movies after bidding the Broadway stage\nadieu in 1949, a decision for which he was severely criticized when his\nstar began to dim in the 1960s and he was excoriated for squandering\nhis talents. No actor ever exerted such a profound influence on\nsucceeding generations of actors as did Brando. More than 50 years\nafter he first scorched the screen as Stanley Kowalski in the movie\nversion of Tennessee Williams'\nA Streetcar Named Desire (1951)\nand a quarter-century after his last great performance as Col. Kurtz in\nFrancis Ford Coppola's\nApocalypse Now (1979), all\nAmerican actors are still being measured by the yardstick that was\nBrando. It was if the shadow of\nJohn Barrymore, the great\nAmerican actor closest to Brando in terms of talent and stardom,\ndominated the acting field up until the 1970s. He did not, nor did any\nother actor so dominate the public's consciousness of what WAS an actor\nbefore or since Brando's 1951 on-screen portrayal of Stanley made him a\ncultural icon. Brando eclipsed the reputation of other great actors\ncirca 1950, such as Paul Muni and\nFredric March. Only the luster of\nSpencer Tracy's reputation hasn't\ndimmed when seen in the starlight thrown off by Brando. However,\nneither Tracy nor Olivier created an entire school of acting just by\nthe force of his personality. Brando did.Marlon Brando, Jr. was born on April 3, 1924, in Omaha, Nebraska, to\nMarlon Brando, Sr., a calcium carbonate salesman, and his artistically\ninclined wife, the former Dorothy Julia Pennebaker. \"Bud\" Brando was\none of three children. His ancestry included English, Irish, German, Dutch, French Huguenot, Welsh, and Scottish;\nhis surname originated with a distant German immigrant ancestor named\n\"Brandau.\" His oldest sister\nJocelyn Brando was also an actress,\ntaking after their mother, who engaged in amateur theatricals and\nmentored a then-unknown Henry Fonda, another\nNebraska native, in her role as director of the Omaha Community\nPlayhouse. Frannie, Brando's other sibling, was a visual artist. Both\nBrando sisters contrived to leave the Midwest for New York City,\nJocelyn to study acting and Frannie to study art. Marlon managed to\nescape the vocational doldrums forecast for him by his cold, distant\nfather and his disapproving schoolteachers by striking out for The Big\nApple in 1943, following Jocelyn into the acting profession. Acting was\nthe only thing he was good at, for which he received praise, so he was\ndetermined to make it his career - a high-school dropout, he had\nnothing else to fall back on, having been rejected by the military due\nto a knee injury he incurred playing football at Shattuck Military\nAcademy, Brando Sr.'s alma mater. The school booted Marlon out as\nincorrigible before graduation.Acting was a skill he honed as a child, the lonely son of alcoholic\nparents. With his father away on the road, and his mother frequently\nintoxicated to the point of stupefaction, the young Bud would play-act\nfor her to draw her out of her stupor and to attract her attention and\nlove. His mother was exceedingly neglectful, but he loved her,\nparticularly for instilling in him a love of nature, a feeling which\ninformed his character Paul in\nLast Tango in Paris (1972)\n(\"Last Tango in Paris\") when he is recalling his childhood for his\nyoung lover Jeanne. \"I don't have many good memories,\" Paul confesses,\nand neither did Brando of his childhood. Sometimes he had to go down to\nthe town jail to pick up his mother after she had spent the night in\nthe drunk tank and bring her home, events that traumatized the young\nboy but may have been the grain that irritated the oyster of his\ntalent, producing the pearls of his performances.\nAnthony Quinn, his Oscar-winning\nco-star in Viva Zapata! (1952) told\nBrando's first wife Anna Kashfi, \"I admire\nMarlon's talent, but I don't envy the pain that created it.\"Brando enrolled in Erwin Piscator's\nDramatic Workshop at New York's New School, and was mentored by\nStella Adler, a member of a famous Yiddish\nTheatre acting family. Adler helped introduce to the New York stage the\n\"emotional memory\" technique of Russian theatrical actor, director and\nimpresario\nKonstantin Stanislavski, whose\nmotto was \"Think of your own experiences and use them truthfully.\" The\nresults of this meeting between an actor and the teacher preparing him\nfor a life in the theater would mark a watershed in American acting and\nculture.Brando made his debut on the boards of Broadway on October 19, 1944, in\n\"I Remember Mama,\" a great success. As a young Broadway actor, Brando\nwas invited by talent scouts from several different studios to\nscreen-test for them, but he turned them down because he would not let\nhimself be bound by the then-standard seven-year contract. Brando would\nmake his film debut quite some time later in\nFred Zinnemann's\nThe Men (1950) for producer\nStanley Kramer. Playing a paraplegic\nsoldier, Brando brought new levels of realism to the screen, expanding\non the verisimilitude brought to movies by Group Theatre alumni\nJohn Garfield, the predecessor\nclosest to him in the raw power he projected on-screen. Ironically, it\nwas Garfield whom producer\nIrene Mayer Selznick had chosen to\nplay the lead in a new\nTennessee Williams play she was about\nto produce, but negotiations broke down when Garfield demanded an\nownership stake in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\"\nBurt Lancaster was next approached, but\ncouldn't get out of a prior film commitment. Then director\nElia Kazan suggested Brando, whom he had\ndirected to great effect in\nMaxwell Anderson's play\n\"Truckline Café,\" in which Brando co-starred with\nKarl Malden, who was to remain a close\nfriend for the next 60 years.During the production of \"Truckline Café,\" Kazan had found that\nBrando's presence was so magnetic, he had to re-block the play to keep\nMarlon near other major characters' stage business, as the audience\ncould not take its eyes off of him. For the scene where Brando's\ncharacter re-enters the stage after killing his wife, Kazan placed him\nupstage-center, partially obscured by scenery, but where the audience\ncould still see him as Karl Malden and\nothers played out their scene within the café set. When he eventually\nentered the scene, crying, the effect was electric. A young\nPauline Kael, arriving late to the play,\nhad to avert her eyes when Brando made this entrance as she believed\nthe young actor on stage was having a real-life conniption. She did not\nlook back until her escort commented that the young man was a great\nactor.The problem with casting Brando as Stanley was that he was much younger\nthan the character as written by Williams. However, after a meeting\nbetween Brando and Williams, the playwright eagerly agreed that Brando\nwould make an ideal Stanley. Williams believed that by casting a\nyounger actor, the Neanderthalish Kowalski would evolve from being a\nvicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be\nattributed to his youthful ignorance. Brando ultimately was\ndissatisfied with his performance, though, saying he never was able to\nbring out the humor of the character, which was ironic as his\ncharacterization often drew laughs from the audience at the expense of\nJessica Tandy's Blanche Dubois. During the\nout-of-town tryouts, Kazan realized that Brando's magnetism was\nattracting attention and audience sympathy away from Blanche to\nStanley, which was not what the playwright intended. The audience's\nsympathy should be solely with Blanche, but many spectators were\nidentifying with Stanley. Kazan queried Williams on the matter,\nbroaching the idea of a slight rewrite to tip the scales back to more\nof a balance between Stanley and Blanche, but Williams demurred,\nsmitten as he was by Brando, just like the preview audiences.For his part, Brando believed that the audience sided with his Stanley\nbecause Jessica Tandy was too shrill. He\nthought Vivien Leigh, who played the part\nin the movie, was ideal, as she was not only a great beauty but she WAS\nBlanche Dubois, troubled as she was in her real life by mental illness\nand nymphomania. Brando's appearance as Stanley on stage and on screen\nrevolutionized American acting by introducing \"The Method\" into\nAmerican consciousness and culture. Method acting, rooted in Adler's\nstudy at the Moscow Art Theatre of Stanislavsky's theories that she\nsubsequently introduced to the Group Theatre, was a more naturalistic\nstyle of performing, as it engendered a close identification of the\nactor with the character's emotions. Adler took first place among\nBrando's acting teachers, and socially she helped turn him from an\nunsophisticated Midwestern farm boy into a knowledgeable and\ncosmopolitan artist who one day would socialize with presidents.Brando didn't like the term \"The Method,\" which quickly became the\nprominent paradigm taught by such acting gurus as\nLee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Brando\ndenounced Strasberg in his autobiography \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\"\n(1994), saying that he was a talentless exploiter who claimed he had\nbeen Brando's mentor. The Actors Studio had been founded by Strasberg\nalong with Kazan and Stella Adler's\nhusband, Harold Clurman, all Group\nTheatre alumni, all political progressives deeply committed to the\ndidactic function of the stage. Brando credits his knowledge of the\ncraft to Adler and Kazan, while Kazan in his autobiography \"A Life\"\nclaimed that Brando's genius thrived due to the thorough training Adler\nhad given him. Adler's method emphasized that authenticity in acting is\nachieved by drawing on inner reality to expose deep emotional\nexperienceInterestingly, Elia Kazan believed that\nBrando had ruined two generations of actors, his contemporaries and\nthose who came after him, all wanting to emulate the great Brando by\nemploying The Method. Kazan felt that Brando was never a Method actor,\nthat he had been highly trained by Adler and did not rely on gut\ninstincts for his performances, as was commonly believed. Many a young\nactor, mistaken about the true roots of Brando's genius, thought that\nall it took was to find a character's motivation, empathize with the\ncharacter through sense and memory association, and regurgitate it all\non stage to become the character. That's not how the superbly trained\nBrando did it; he could, for example, play accents, whereas your\naverage American Method actor could not. There was a method to Brando's\nart, Kazan felt, but it was not The Method.After\nA Streetcar Named Desire (1951),\nfor which he received the first of his eight Academy Award nominations,\nBrando appeared in a string of Academy Award-nominated performances -\nin Viva Zapata! (1952),\nJulius Caesar (1953) and the summit\nof his early career, Kazan's\nOn the Waterfront (1954). For\nhis \"Waterfront\" portrayal of meat-headed longshoreman Terry Malloy,\nthe washed-up pug who \"coulda been a contender,\" Brando won his first\nOscar. Along with his iconic performance as the rebel-without-a-cause\nJohnny in The Wild One (1953) (\"What\nare you rebelling against?\" Johnny is asked. \"What have ya got?\" is his\nreply), the first wave of his career was, according to\nJon Voight, unprecedented in its audacious\npresentation of such a wide range of great acting. Director\nJohn Huston said his performance of\nMarc Antony was like seeing the door of a furnace opened in a dark\nroom, and co-star John Gielgud, the premier\nShakespearean actor of the 20th century, invited Brando to join his\nrepertory company.It was this period of 1951-54 that revolutionized American acting,\nspawning such imitators as James Dean - who modeled his acting and even his lifestyle on his hero Brando - the young Paul Newman and\nSteve McQueen. After Brando, every up-and-coming star with true acting talent and a brooding, alienated quality would be hailed as the \"New Brando,\" such as\nWarren Beatty in Kazan's\nSplendor in the Grass (1961).\n\"We are all Brando's children,\"\nJack Nicholson pointed out in\n1972. \"He gave us our freedom.\" He was truly \"The Godfather\" of\nAmerican acting - and he was just 30 years old. Though he had a couple of failures, like Désirée (1954) and The Teahouse of the August Moon (1956), he was clearly miscast in them and hadn't sought out the parts so largely escaped blame.In the second period of his career, 1955-62, Brando managed to uniquely\nestablish himself as a great actor who also was a Top 10 movie star,\nalthough that star began to dim after the box-office high point of his\nearly career, Sayonara (1957) (for which\nhe received his fifth Best Actor Oscar nomination). Brando tried his\nhand at directing a film, the well-reviewed\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961) that he made\nfor his own production company, Pennebaker Productions (after his\nmother's maiden name). Stanley Kubrick\nhad been hired to direct the film, but after months of script rewrites\nin which Brando participated, Kubrick and Brando had a falling out and\nKubrick was sacked. According to his widow\nChristiane Kubrick, Stanley believed\nthat Brando had wanted to direct the film himself all along.Tales proliferated about the profligacy of Brando the director, burning\nup a million and a half feet of expensive VistaVision film at 50 cents\na foot, fully ten times the normal amount of raw stock expended during\nproduction of an equivalent motion picture. Brando took so long editing\nthe film that he was never able to present the studio with a cut.\nParamount took it away from him and tacked on a re-shot ending that\nBrando was dissatisfied with, as it made the Oedipal figure of Dad\nLongworth into a villain. In any normal film Dad would have been the\nheavy, but Brando believed that no one was innately evil, that it was a\nmatter of an individual responding to, and being molded by, one's\nenvironment. It was not a black-and-white world, Brando felt, but a\ngray world in which once-decent people could do horrible things. This\nattitude explains his sympathetic portrayal of Nazi officer Christian\nDiestl in the film he made before shooting\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961),\nEdward Dmytryk's filming of\nIrwin Shaw's novel\nThe Young Lions (1958). Shaw\ndenounced Brando's performance, but audiences obviously disagreed, as\nthe film was a major hit. It would be the last hit movie Brando would\nhave for more than a decade.One-Eyed Jacks (1961) generated\nrespectable numbers at the box office, but the production costs were\nexorbitant - a then-staggering $6 million - which made it run a\ndeficit. A film essentially is \"made\" in the editing room, and Brando\nfound cutting to be a terribly boring process, which was why the studio\neventually took the film away from him. Despite his proved talent in\nhandling actors and a large production, Brando never again directed\nanother film, though he would claim that all actors essentially direct\nthemselves during the shooting of a picture.Between the production and release of\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961), Brando\nappeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of\nTennessee Williams' play \"Orpheus Descending,\"\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960) which\nteamed him with fellow Oscar winners\nAnna Magnani and\nJoanne Woodward. Following in\nElizabeth Taylor's trailblazing\nfootsteps, Brando became the second performer to receive a $1-million\nsalary for a motion picture, so high were the expectations for this\nre-teaming of Kowalski and his creator (in 1961 critic\nHollis Alpert had published a book \"Brando\nand the Shadow of Stanley Kowalski\"). Critics and audiences waiting for\nanother incendiary display from Brando in a Williams work were\ndisappointed when the renamed\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960)\nfinally released. Though Tennessee was hot, with movie versions of\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)\nand\nSuddenly, Last Summer (1959)\nburning up the box office and receiving kudos from the Academy of\nMotion Picture Arts & Sciences,\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960) was a\nfailure. This was followed by the so-so box-office reception of\nOne-Eyed Jacks (1961) in 1961 and\nthen by a failure of a more monumental kind:\nMutiny on the Bounty (1962),\na remake of the famed 1935 film.Brando signed on to\nMutiny on the Bounty (1962)\nafter turning down the lead in the\nDavid Lean classic\nLawrence of Arabia (1962)\nbecause he didn't want to spend a year in the desert riding around on a\ncamel. He received another $1-million salary, plus $200,000 in overages\nas the shoot went overtime and over budget. During principal\nphotography, highly respected director\nCarol Reed (an eventual Academy Award\nwinner) was fired, and his replacement, two-time Oscar winner\nLewis Milestone, was shunted aside by\nBrando as Marlon basically took over the direction of the film himself.\nThe long shoot became so notorious that President\nJohn F. Kennedy asked director\nBilly Wilder at a cocktail party not \"when\"\nbut \"if\" the \"Bounty\" shoot would ever be over. The MGM remake of one\nof its classic Golden Age films garnered a Best Picture Oscar\nnomination and was one of the top grossing films of 1962, yet failed to\ngo into the black due to its Brobdingnagian budget estimated at $20\nmillion, which is equivalent to $120 million when adjusted for\ninflation.Brando and Taylor, whose\nCleopatra (1963) nearly bankrupted 20th\nCentury-Fox due to its huge cost overruns (its final budget was more\nthan twice that of Brando's\nMutiny on the Bounty (1962)),\nwere pilloried by the show business press for being the epitome of the\npampered, self-indulgent stars who were ruining the industry. Seeking\nscapegoats, the Hollywood press conveniently ignored the financial\npressures on the studios. The studios had been hurt by television and\nby the antitrust-mandated divestiture of their movie theater chains,\ncausing a large outflow of production to Italy and other countries in\nthe 1950s and 1960s in order to lower costs. The studio bosses, seeking\nto replicate such blockbuster hits as the remakes of\nThe Ten Commandments (1956)\nand Ben-Hur (1959), were the real\nculprits behind the losses generated by large-budgeted films that found\nit impossible to recoup their costs despite long lines at the box\noffice.While Elizabeth Taylor, receiving the unwanted gift of reams of\npublicity from her adulterous romance with\nCleopatra (1963) co-star\nRichard Burton, remained hot\nuntil the tanking of her own Tennessee Williams-renamed debacle\nBoom! (1968), Brando from 1963 until the end\nof the decade appeared in one box-office failure after another as he\nworked out a contract he had signed with Universal Pictures. The\nindustry had grown tired of Brando and his idiosyncrasies, though he\ncontinued to be offered prestige projects up through 1968.Some of the films Brando made in the 1960s were noble failures, such as\nThe Ugly American (1963),\nThe Appaloosa (1966) and\nReflections in a Golden Eye (1967).\nFor every \"Reflections,\" though, there seemed to be two or three\noutright debacles, such as\nBedtime Story (1964), Morituri (1965), The Chase (1966),\nA Countess from Hong Kong (1967), Candy (1968),\nThe Night of the Following Day (1969).\nBy the time Brando began making the anti-colonialist picture\nBurn! (1969) in Colombia with\nGillo Pontecorvo in the director's\nchair, he was box-office poison, despite having worked in the previous\nfive years with such top directors as\nArthur Penn,\nJohn Huston and the legendary\nCharles Chaplin, and with such\ntop-drawer co-stars as David Niven,\nYul Brynner,\nSophia Loren and Taylor.The rap on Brando in the 1960s was that a great talent had ruined his\npotential to be America's answer to\nLaurence Olivier, as his friend\nWilliam Redfield limned the dilemma in\nhis book \"Letters from an Actor\" (1967), a memoir about Redfield's\nappearance in Burton's 1964 theatrical production of \"Hamlet.\" By\nfailing to go back on stage and recharge his artistic batteries,\nsomething British actors such as Burton were not afraid to do, Brando\nhad stifled his great talent, by refusing to tackle the classical\nrepertoire and contemporary drama. Actors and critics had yearned for\nan American response to the high-acting style of the Brits, and while\nMethod actors such as Rod Steiger tried to\ncreate an American style, they were hampered in their quest, as their\nking was lost in a wasteland of Hollywood movies that were beneath his\ntalent. Many of his early supporters now turned on him, claiming he was\na crass sellout.Despite evidence in such films as\nThe Appaloosa (1966) and\nReflections in a Golden Eye (1967)\nthat Brando was in fact doing some of the best acting of his life,\ncritics, perhaps with an eye on the box office, slammed him for failing\nto live up to, and nurture, his great gift. Brando's political\nactivism, starting in the early 1960s with his championing of Native\nAmericans' rights, followed by his participation in the Southern\nChristian Leadership Conference's March on Washington in 1963, and\nfollowed by his appearance at a Black Panther rally in 1968, did not\nwin him many admirers in the establishment. In fact, there was a de\nfacto embargo on Brando films in the recently segregated (officially,\nat least) southeastern US in the 1960s. Southern exhibitors simply\nwould not book his films, and producers took notice. After 1968, Brando\nwould not work for three years.Pauline Kael wrote of Brando that he was\nFortune's fool. She drew a parallel with the latter career of\nJohn Barrymore, a similarly\ngifted thespian with talents as prodigious, who seemingly threw them\naway. Brando, like the late-career Barrymore, had become a great ham,\nevidenced by his turn as the faux Indian guru in the egregious\nCandy (1968), seemingly because the\nmaterial was so beneath his talent. Most observers of Brando in the\n1960s believed that he needed to be reunited with his old mentor\nElia Kazan, a relationship that had soured\ndue to Kazan's friendly testimony naming names before the notorious\nHouse un-American Activities Committee. Perhaps Brando believed this,\ntoo, as he originally accepted an offer to appear as the star of\nKazan's film adaptation of his own novel,\nThe Arrangement (1969). However,\nafter the assassination of\nMartin Luther King, Brando backed out\nof the film, telling Kazan that he could not appear in a Hollywood film\nafter this tragedy. Also reportedly turning down a role opposite\nbox-office king Paul Newman in a\nsurefire script,\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969),\nBrando decided to make Burn! (1969)\nwith Pontecorvo. The film, a searing indictment of racism and\ncolonialism, flopped at the box office but won the esteem of\nprogressive critics and cultural arbiters such as\nHoward Zinn. He subsequently appeared in the British film The Nightcomers (1971), a prequel to \"Turn of the Screw\" and another critical and box office failure.Kazan, after a life in film and the theater, said that, aside from\nOrson Welles, whose greatness lay in\nfilm making, he only met one actor who was a genius: Brando. Richard\nBurton, an intellectual with a keen eye for observation if not for his\nown film projects, said that he found Brando to be very bright, unlike\nthe public perception of him as a Terry Malloy-type character that he\nhimself inadvertently promoted through his boorish behavior. Brando's\nproblem, Burton felt, was that he was unique, and that he had gotten\ntoo much fame too soon at too early an age. Cut off from being nurtured\nby normal contact with society, fame had distorted Brando's personality\nand his ability to cope with the world, as he had not had time to grow\nup outside the limelight.Truman Capote, who eviscerated Brando in\nprint in the mid-'50s and had as much to do with the public perception\nof the dyslexic Brando as a dumbbell, always said that the best actors\nwere ignorant, and that an intelligent person could not be a good\nactor. However, Brando was highly intelligent, and possessed of a rare\ngenius in a then-deprecated art, acting. The problem that an\nintelligent performer has in movies is that it is the director, and not\nthe actor, who has the power in his chosen field. Greatness in the\nother arts is defined by how much control the artist is able to exert\nover his chosen medium, but in movie acting, the medium is controlled\nby a person outside the individual artist. It is an axiom of the cinema\nthat a performance, as is a film, is \"created\" in the cutting room,\nthus further removing the actor from control over his art. Brando had\ntried his hand at directing, in controlling the whole artistic\nenterprise, but he could not abide the cutting room, where a film and\nthe film's performances are made. This lack of control over his art was\nthe root of Brando's discontent with acting, with movies, and,\neventually, with the whole wide world that invested so much cachet in\nmovie actors, as long as \"they\" were at the top of the box-office\ncharts. Hollywood was a matter of \"they\" and not the work, and Brando\nbecame disgusted.Charlton Heston, who participated in\nMartin Luther King's 1963 March on\nWashington with Brando, believes that Marlon was the great actor of his\ngeneration. However, noting a story that Brando had once refused a role\nin the early 1960s with the excuse \"How can I act when people are\nstarving in India?,\" Heston believes that it was this attitude, the\ninability to separate one's idealism from one's work, that prevented\nBrando from reaching his potential. As\nRod Steiger once said, Brando had it all,\ngreat stardom and a great talent. He could have taken his audience on a\ntrip to the stars, but he simply would not. Steiger, one of Brando's\nchildren even though a contemporary, could not understand it. When\nJames Mason' was asked in 1971 who\nwas the best American actor, he had replied that since Brando had let\nhis career go belly-up, it had to be\nGeorge C. Scott, by default.Paramount thought that only\nLaurence Olivier would suffice, but\nLord Olivier was ill. The young director believed there was only one\nactor who could play godfather to the group of Young Turk actors he had\nassembled for his film, The Godfather of method acting himself - Marlon\nBrando. Francis Ford Coppola won\nthe fight for Brando, Brando won - and refused - his second Oscar, and\nParamount won a pot of gold by producing the then top-grossing film of\nall-time, The Godfather (1972), a\ngangster movie most critics now judge one of the greatest American\nfilms of all time. Brando followed his iconic portrayal of Don Corleone\nwith his Oscar-nominated turn in the high-grossing and highly\nscandalous\nLast Tango in Paris (1972)\n(\"Last Tango in Paris\"), the first film dealing explicitly with\nsexuality in which an actor of Brando's stature had participated. He\nwas now again a top ten box office star and once again heralded as the\ngreatest actor of his generation, an unprecedented comeback that put\nhim on the cover of \"Time\" magazine and would make him the highest-paid\nactor in the history of motion pictures by the end of the decade.\nLittle did the world know that Brando, who had struggled through many\nprojects in good faith during the 1960s, delivering some of his best\nacting, only to be excoriated and ignored as the films did not do well\nat the box office, essentially was through with the movies.After reaching the summit of his career, a rarefied atmosphere never\nreached before or since by any actor, Brando essentially walked away.\nHe would give no more of himself after giving everything as he had done\nin Last Tango in Paris (1972),\" a performance that embarrassed him, according\nto his autobiography. Brando had come as close to any actor to being\nthe \"auteur,\" or author, of a film, as the English-language scenes of\n\"Tango\" were created by encouraging Brando to improvise. The\nimprovisations were written down and turned into a shooting script, and\nthe scripted improvisations were shot the next day.\nPauline Kael, the Brando of movie critics\nin that she was the most influential arbiter of cinematic quality of\nher generation and spawned a whole legion of Kael wannabes, said\nBrando's performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972) had revolutionized the art of\nfilm. Brando, who had to act to gain his mother's attention; Brando,\nwho believed acting at best was nothing special as everyone in the\nworld engaged in it every day of their lives to get what they wanted\nfrom other people; Brando, who believed acting at its worst was a\nchildish charade and that movie stardom was a whorish fraud, would have\nagreed with Sam Peckinpah's summation of\nPauline Kael: \"Pauline's a brilliant critic\nbut sometimes she's just cracking walnuts with her ass.\" He probably would have done so in a\nsimulacrum of those words, too.After another three-year hiatus, Brando took on just one more major\nrole for the next 20 years, as the bounty hunter after\nJack Nicholson in\nArthur Penn's\nThe Missouri Breaks (1976), a\nwestern that succeeded neither with the critics or at the box office. Following The Godfather and Tango, Brando's performance was disappointing for some reviewers, who accused him of giving an erratic and inconsistent performance. In 1977, Brando made a rare appearance on television in the miniseries Roots: The Next Generations (1979), portraying George Lincoln Rockwell; he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for his performance. In 1978, he narrated the English version of Raoni (1978), a French-Belgian documentary film directed by Jean-Pierre Dutilleux and Luiz Carlos Saldanha that focused on the life of Raoni Metuktire and issues surrounding the survival of the indigenous Indian tribes of north central Brazil.Later in his career, Brando concentrated on extracting the maximum amount of\ncapital for the least amount of work from producers, as when he got the\nSalkind brothers to pony up a then-record $3.7 million against 10% of\nthe gross for 13 days work on\nSuperman (1978). Factoring in inflation,\nthe straight salary for \"Superman\" equals or exceeds the new record of\n$1 million a day Harrison Ford set\nwith\nK-19: The Widowmaker (2002). He agreed to the role only on assurance that he would be paid a large sum for what amounted to a small part, that he would not have to read the script beforehand, and his lines would be displayed somewhere off-camera. Brando also filmed scenes for the movie's sequel, Superman II, but after producers refused to pay him the same percentage he received for the first movie, he denied them permission to use the footage.Before cashing his first paycheck for\nSuperman (1978), Brando had picked up $2\nmillion for his extended cameo in\nFrancis Ford Coppola's\nApocalypse Now (1979) in a role,\nthat of Col. Kurtz, that he authored on-camera through improvisation\nwhile Coppola shot take after take. It was Brando's last bravura star\nperformance. He co-starred with George C. Scott and John Gielgud in The Formula (1980), but the film was another critical and financial failure. Years later though, he did receive an eighth and final Oscar nomination\nfor his supporting role in A Dry White Season (1989)\nafter coming out of a near-decade-long retirement. Contrary to those\nwho claimed he now only was in it for the money, Brando donated his\nentire seven-figure salary to an anti-apartheid charity. He then did an amusing performance in the comedy The Freshman (1990), winning rave reviews. He portrayed Tomas de Torquemada in the historical drama 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), but his performance was denounced and the film was another box office failure. He made another comeback in the Johnny Depp romantic drama Don Juan DeMarco (1994), which co-starred Faye Dunaway as his wife. He then appeared in The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996), co-starring Val Kilmer, who he didn't get along with. The filming was an unpleasant experience for Brando, as well as another critical and box office failure.Brando had first attracted media attention at the age of 24, when\n\"Life\" magazine ran a photo of himself and his sister Jocelyn, who were\nboth then appearing on Broadway. The curiosity continued, and\nsnowballed. Playing the paraplegic soldier of\nThe Men (1950), Brando had gone to live\nat a Veterans Administration hospital with actual disabled veterans,\nand confined himself to a wheelchair for weeks. It was an acting\nmethod, research, that no one in Hollywood had ever heard of before,\nand that willingness to experience life.",

        "job": "Bale was invited to speak at the American Film Institute Tribute to director Steven Spielberg. The gala event aired on A&E in North America on September 7, 1995.",
        "bio": "Christian Charles Philip Bale was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK on January 30, 1974, to English parents Jennifer \"Jenny\" (James) and David Bale. His mother was a circus performer and his father, who was born in South Africa, was a commercial pilot. The family lived in different countries throughout Bale's childhood, including England, Portugal, and the United States. Bale acknowledges the constant change was one of the influences on his career choice.His first acting job was a cereal commercial in 1983; amazingly, the next year, he debuted on the West End stage in \"The Nerd\". A role in the 1986 NBC mini-series Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986) caught Steven Spielberg's eye, leading to Bale's well-documented role in Empire of the Sun (1987). For the range of emotions he displayed as the star of the war epic, he earned a special award by the National Board of Review for Best Performance by a Juvenile Actor.Adjusting to fame and his difficulties with attention (he thought about quitting acting early on), Bale appeared in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V (1989) and starred as Jim Hawkins in a TV movie version of Treasure Island (1990). Bale worked consistently through the 1990s, acting and singing in Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), Little Women (1994), The Portrait of a Lady (1996), The Secret Agent (1996), Metroland (1997), Velvet Goldmine (1998), All the Little Animals (1998), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (1999). Toward the end of the decade, with the rise of the Internet, Bale found himself becoming one of the most popular online celebrities around, though he, with a couple notable exceptions, maintained a private, tabloid-free mystique.Bale roared into the next decade with a lead role in American Psycho (2000), director Mary Harron's adaptation of the controversial Bret Easton Ellis novel. In the film, Bale played a murderous Wall Street executive obsessed with his own physicality - a trait for which Bale would become a specialist. Subsequently, the 10th Anniversary issue for \"Entertainment Weekly\" crowned Bale one of the \"Top 8 Most Powerful Cult Figures\" of the past decade, citing his cult status on the Internet. EW also called Bale one of the \"Most Creative People in Entertainment\", and \"Premiere\" lauded him as one of the \"Hottest Leading Men Under 30\".Bale was truly on the Hollywood radar at this time, and he turned in a range of performances in the remake Shaft (2000), Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001), the balmy Laurel Canyon (2002), and Reign of Fire (2002), a dragons-and-magic commercial misfire that has its share of defenders.Two more cult films followed: Equilibrium (2002) and The Machinist (2004), the latter of which gained attention mainly due to Bale's physical transformation - he dropped a reported 60+ pounds for the role of a lathe operator with a secret that causes him to suffer from insomnia for over a year.Bale's abilities to transform his body and to disappear into a character influenced the decision to cast him in Batman Begins (2005), the first chapter in Christopher Nolan's definitive trilogy that proved a dark-themed narrative could resonate with audiences worldwide. The film also resurrected a character that had been shelved by Warner Bros. after a series of demising returns, capped off by the commercial and critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997). A quiet, personal victory for Bale: he accepted the role after the passing of his father in late 2003, an event that caused him to question whether he would continue performing.Bale segued into two indie features in the wake of Batman's phenomenal success: The New World (2005) and Harsh Times (2005). He continued working with respected independent directors in 2006's Rescue Dawn (2006), Werner Herzog's feature version of his earlier, Emmy-nominated documentary, Little Dieter Needs to Fly (1997). Leading up to the second Batman film, Bale starred in The Prestige (2006), the remake of 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and a reunion with director Todd Haynes in the experimental Bob Dylan biography, I'm Not There (2007).Anticipation for The Dark Knight (2008) was spun into unexpected heights with the tragic passing of Heath Ledger, whose performance as The Joker became the highlight of the sequel. Bale's graceful statements to the press reminded us of the days of the refined Hollywood star as the second installment exceeded the box-office performance of its predecessor.Bale's next role was the eyebrow-raising decision to take over the role of John Connor in the Schwarzenegger-less Terminator Salvation (2009), followed by a turn as federal agent Melvin Purvis in Michael Mann's Public Enemies (2009). Both films were hits but not the blockbusters they were expected to be.For all his acclaim and box-office triumphs, Bale would earn his first Oscar in 2011 in the wake of The Fighter (2010)'s critical and commercial success. Bale earned the Best Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Dicky Eklund, brother to and trainer of boxer \"Irish\" Micky Ward, played by Mark Wahlberg. Bale again showed his ability to reshape his body with another gaunt, skeletal transformation.Bale then turned to another auteur, Yimou Zhang, for the epic The Flowers of War (2011), in which Bale portrayed a priest trapped in the midst of the Rape of Nanking. Bale earned headlines for his attempt to visit with Chinese civil-rights activist Chen Guangcheng, which was blocked by the Chinese government.Bale capped his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Dark Knight Rises (2012); in the wake of the Aurora, Colorado tragedy, Bale made a quiet pilgrimage to the state to visit with survivors of the attack that left theatergoers dead and injured. He also starred in the thriller Out of the Furnace (2013) with Crazy Heart (2009) writer/director Scott Cooper, and the drama-comedy American Hustle (2013), reuniting with David O. Russell.Bale will re-team with The New World (2005) director Terrence Malick for two upcoming projects: Knight of Cups (2015) and an as-yet-untitled drama.In his personal life, he devotes time to charities including Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Foundation. He lives with his wife, Sibi Blazic, and their two children.",

Her great grandparents 'Loch & Lomond' were renowned Variety and Vaudevillian performers, as were her grandparents who met whilst performing for the judges and diplomats at The Nuremberg war trials (introduced by their mutual agent and her godfather - the late Lord Lew Grade) . Siobhan's grandmother was the last remaining captain of the Bluebell girls - the high kicking can can troupe who danced her way from Ireland around Europe and South America in the 20's and 30's, working with Mistanguette, Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, and Jaques Tati. Her Grandfather, was a celebrated knock about comic whose act involved multiple back flips off walls. Her Great Aunt's Karina and sister the world famous Eve - were renowned contortionists. Siobhan's late Father, Donald Hewlett was a famous TV star from Jimmy Perry & David Crofts hit shows 'It Ain't half Hot Mum' & 'You Rang M'Lord' . Siobhan's Mother, Thérèse McMurray was a child star and lead in the first live hospital show 'Emergency Ward 10'.Hewlett was brought up between the West of Ireland (Lahinch) and the East Kent coast of England (Whitstable).Educated in England, Hewlett attended Wellesley House School, Downe House School and The King's School, Canterbury on art scholarships.\nA period of family ill health during Siobhán's childhood meant that she became her family's main carer.\nWhilst at The King's School, Canterbury, she was spotted in a production by the theatrical agent Hamilton Hodell, turned down a place at Cambridge to read English and subsequently won a scholarship to study acting at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London for their 3 year classical acting diploma course.Hewlett supported herself through drama school by waitressing, singing and playing her guitar in Jazz clubs around London.Whilst still at drama school at 19, Hewlett was chosen by French film director Antoine de Caunes to play the leading role in Monsieur N a role that required she learn French.Shortly afterwards Hewlett starred in the British comedy series 'Fortysomething' opposite Hugh Laurie, Benedict Cumberbatch and Peter Capaldi for ITV. Hewlett and Cumberbatch were old family friends - Wanda Ventham, Cumberbatch's mother and Hewlett's Father had starred opposite each in London's West End.Hewlett made her professional stage debut at The Finborough Theatre in London - starring opposite Chis O' Dowd, Clarke Peters and Daniela Nardini in Etta Jenks.

        "bio": "One of seven children, Frank Capra was born on May 18, 1897, in\nBisacquino, Sicily. On May 10, 1903, his family left for America aboard\nthe ship Germania, arriving in New York on May 23rd. \"There's no\nventilation, and it stinks like hell. They're all miserable. It's the\nmost degrading place you could ever be,\" Capra said about his Atlantic\npassage. \"Oh, it was awful, awful. It seems to always be storming,\nraining like hell and very windy, with these big long rolling Atlantic\nwaves. Everybody was sick, vomiting. God, they were sick. And the poor\nkids were always crying.\"The family boarded a train for the trip to California, where Frank's\nolder brother Benjamin was living. On their journey, they subsisted on\nbread and bananas, as their lack of English made it impossible for them\nto ask for any other kind of foodstuffs. On June 3, the Capra family\narrived at the Southern Pacific station in Los Angeles, at the time, a\nsmall city of approximately 102,000 people. The family stayed with\nCapra's older brother Benjamin, and on September 14, 1903, Frank began\nhis schooling at the Castelar Elementary school.In 1909, he entered Los Angeles' Manual Arts High School. Capra made\nmoney selling newspapers in downtown L.A. after school and on\nSaturdays, sometimes working with his brother Tony. When sales were\nslow, Tony punched Frank to attract attention, which would attract a\ncrowd and make Frank's papers sell quicker. Frank later became part of\na two-man music combo, playing at various places in the red light\ndistrict of L.A., including brothels, getting paid a dollar per night,\nperforming the popular songs. He also worked as a janitor at the high\nschool in the early mornings. It was at high school that he became\ninterested in the theater, typically doing back-stage work such as\nlighting.Capra's family pressured him to drop out of school and go to work, but\nhe refused, as he wanted to partake fully of the American Dream, and\nfor that he needed an education. Capra later reminisced that his family\n\"thought I was a bum. My mother would slap me around; she wanted me to\nquit school. My teachers would urge me to keep going....I was going to\nschool because I had a fight on my hands that I wanted to win.\"Capra graduated from high school on January 27, 1915, and in September\nof that year, he entered the Throop College of Technology (later the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology) to study chemical engineering. The\nschool's annual tuition was $250, and Capra received occasional\nfinancial support from his family, who were resigned to the fact they\nhad a scholar in their midst. Throop had a fine arts department, and\nCapra discovered poetry and the essays of Montaigne, which he fell in\nlove with, while matriculating at the technical school. He then decided\nto write.\"It was a great discovery for me. I discovered language. I discovered\npoetry. I discovered poetry at Caltech, can you imagine that? That was\na big turning point in my life. I didn't know anything could be so\nbeautiful.\" Capra penned \"The Butler's Failure,\" about an English\nbutler provoked by poverty to murder his employer, then to suicide.\"Capra was singled out for a cash award of $250 for having the highest\ngrades in the school. Part of his prize was a six-week trip across the\nU.S. and Canada. When Capra's father, Turiddu, died in 1916, Capra\nstarted working at the campus laundry to make money.After the U.S. Congress declared War on Germany on April 6, 1917, Capra\nenlisted in the Army, and while he was not a naturalized citizen yet,\nhe was allowed to join the military as part of the Coastal Artillery.\nCapra became a supply officer for the student soldiers at Throop, who\nhave been enrolled in a Reserve Officers Training Corps program. At his\nenlistment, Capra discovered he was not an American citizen; he became\nnaturalized in 1920.On September 15, 1918, Capra graduated from Throop with his bachelor's\ndegree, and was inducted into the U.S. Army on October 18th and shipped\nout to the Presidio at San Francisco. An armistice ending the fighting\nof World War One would be declared in less than a month. While at the\nPresidio, Capra became ill with the Spanish influenza that claimed 20\nmillion lives worldwide. He was discharged from the Army on December\n13th and moved to his brother Ben's home in L.A. While recuperating,\nCapra answered a cattle call for extras for\nJohn Ford's film \"The\nThe Outcasts of Poker Flat (1919)\n(Capra, cast as a laborer in the Ford picture, introduced himself to\nthe film's star, Harry Carey. Two decades\nlater, Capra, designated the #1 director in Hollywood by \"Time\"\nmagazine, would cast Carey and his movie actress wife Olive in\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\nfor which Carey won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination).While living at his mother's house, Capra took on a wide variety of\nmanual laboring jobs, including errand boy and ditch digger, even\nworking as an orange tree pruner at 20 cents a day. He continued to be\nemployed as an extra at movie studios and as a prop buyer at an\nindependent studio at Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street, which later\nbecame the home of Columbia Pictures, where Capra would make his\nreputation as the most successful movie director of the 1930s. Most of\nhis time was spent unemployed and idle, which gave credence to his\nfamily's earlier opposition to him seeking higher education. Capra\nwrote short stories but was unable to get them published. He eventually\ngot work as a live-in tutor for the son of \"Lucky\" Baldwin, a rich\ngambler. (He later used the Baldwin estate as a location for\nDirigible (1931)).Smitten by the movie bug, in August of that year, Capra, former actor\nW. M. Plank, and financial backer Ida May Heitmann incorporated the\nTri-State Motion Picture Co. in Nevada. Tri-State produced three short\nfilms in Nevada in 1920,\nDon't Change Your Husband (1919),\nThe Pulse of Life (1917), and\nThe Scar of Love (1920), all directed by Plank, and possibly based on\nstory treatments written by Capra. The films were failures, and Capra\nreturned to Los Angeles when Tri-State broke up. In March 1920, Capra\nwas employed by CBC Film Sales Co., the corporate precursor of Columbia\nFilms, where he also worked as an editor and director on a series\ncalled \"Screen Snapshots.\" He quit CBC in August and moved to San\nFrancisco, but the only jobs he could find were that of bookseller and\ndoor-to-door salesman. Once again seeming to fulfill his family's\nprophecy, he turned to gambling, and also learned to ride the rails\nwith a hobo named Frank Dwyer. There was also a rumor that he became a\ntraveling salesman specializing in worthless securities, according to a\n\"Time\" magazine story \"Columbia's Gem\" (August 8, 1938 issue, V.32, No.\n6).Still based in San Francisco in 1921, producer\nWalter Montague hired Capra for $75 per\nweek to help direct the short movie\nThe Ballad of Fisher's Boarding House (1922),\nwhich was based on a poem by\nRudyard Kipling. Montague, a former\nactor, had the dubious idea that foggy San Francisco was destined to\nbecome the capital of movies, and that he could make a fortune making\nmovies based on poems. Capra helped Montague produced the one-reeler,\nwhich was budgeted at $1,700 and subsequently sold to the Pathe\nExchange for $3,500. Capra quit Montague when he demanded that the next\nmovie be based upon one of his own poems.Unable to find another professional filmmaking job, Capra hired himself\nout as a maker of shorts for the public-at-large while working as an\nassistant at Walter Ball's film lab. Finally, in October 1921, the Paul\nGerson Picture Corp. hired him to help make its two-reel comedies,\naround the time that he began dating the actress Helen Edith Howe, who\nwould become his first wife. Capra continued to work for both Ball and\nGerson, primarily as a cutter. On November 25, 1923, Capra married\nHelen Howell, and the couple soon moved to Hollywood.Hal Roach hired Capra as a gag-writer\nfor the \"Our Gang\" series in January, 1924. After writing the gags for\nfive \"Our Gang\" comedies in seven weeks, he asked Roach to make him a\ndirector. When Roach refused (he somewhat rightly felt he had found the\nright man in director Bob McGowan),\nCapra quit. Roach's arch rival Mack Sennett\nsubsequently hired him as a writer, one of a six-man team that wrote\nfor silent movie comedian\nHarry Langdon, the last major star\nof the rapidly disintegrating Mack Sennett Studios, and reigning\nbriefly as fourth major silent comedian after\nCharles Chaplin,\nBuster Keaton, and\nHarold Lloyd. Capra began working\nwith the Harry Langdon production\nunit as a gag writer, first credited on the short\nPlain Clothes (1925).As Harry Langdon became more\npopular, his production unit at Sennett had moved from two- to\nthree-reelers before Langdon, determined to follow the example of\nChaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd, went into features. After making his first\nfeature-length comedy,\nHis First Flame (1927) for\nSennett, Langdon signed a three-year contract with\nSol Lesser's First National Pictures to\nannually produce two feature-length comedies at a fixed fee per film.\nFor a multitude of reasons Mack Sennett was\nnever able to retain top talent. On September 15, 1925,\nHarry Langdon left Sennett in an\negotistical rage, taking many of his key production personnel with him.\nSennett promoted Capra to director but fired him after three days in\nhis new position. In addition to the Langdon comedies, Capra had also\nwritten material for other Sennett films, eventually working on\ntwenty-five movies.After being sacked by Sennett, Capra was hired as a gag-writer by\nHarry Langdon, working on\nLangdon's first First National feature-length film,\nTramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926).\nThe movie was directed by\nHarry Edwards who had directed all\nof Harry Langdon's films at\nSennett. His first comedy for First National,\nTramp, Tramp, Tramp (1926)\ndid well at the box office, but it had ran over budget, which came out\nof Langdon's end. Harry Edwards was sacked, and for his next picture,\nThe Strong Man (1926), Langdon\npromoted Capra to director, boosting his salary to $750 per week. The\nmovie was a hit, but trouble was brewing among members of the\nHarry Langdon company. Langdon was\nincreasingly believing his own press.His marriage with Helen began to unravel when it is discovered that she\nhad a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy that had to be terminated. In\norder to cope with the tragedy, Capra became a work-a-holic while Helen\nturned to drink. The deterioration of his marriage was mirrored by the\ndisintegration of his professional relationship with\nHarry Langdonduring the making of\nthe new feature, Long Pants (1927).The movie, which was released in March 1927, proved to be Capra's last\nwith Harry Langdon, as the\ncomedian soon sacked Capra after its release. Capra later explained the\nprinciple of Langdon comedies to James Agee,\n\"It is the principal of the brick: If there was a rule for writing\nLangdon material, it was this: his only ally was God.\nHarry Langdon might be saved by a\nbrick falling on a cop, but it was verboten that he in any way\nmotivated the bricks fall.\"During the production of\nLong Pants (1926), Capra had a falling\nout with Langdon. Screenwriter\nArthur Ripley's dark sensibility\ndid not mesh well with that of the more optimistic Capra, and\nHarry Langdon usually sided with\nRipley. The picture fell behind schedule and went over budget, and\nsince Langdon was paid a fixed fee for each film, this represented a\nfinancial loss to his own Harry Langdon Corp. Stung by the financial\nset-back, and desiring to further emulate the great Chaplin,\nHarry Langdon made a fateful\ndecision: He fired Capra and decided to direct himself. (Langdon's next\nthree movies for First National were dismal failures, the two surviving\nfilms being very dark and grim black comedies, one of which,\nThe Chaser (1928), touched on the\nsubject of suicide. It was the late years of the Jazz Age, a time of\nunprecedented prosperity and boundless bonhomie, and the critics, and\nmore critically, the ticket-buying public, rejected Harry. In 1928,\nFirst National did not pick up his contract. The Harry Langdon Corp.\nsoon went bankrupt, and his career as the \"fourth major silent\ncomedian\" was through, just as sound was coming in.)In April of 1927, Capra and his wife Helen split up, and Capra went off\nto New York to direct\nFor the Love of Mike (1927)\nfor First National, his first picture with\nClaudette Colbert. The\ndirector and his star did not get along, and the film went over budget.\nSubsequently, First National refused to pay Capra, and he had to\nhitchhike back to Hollywood. The film proved to be Capra's only genuine\nflop.By September 1927, he was back working as a writer for\nMack Sennett, but in October, he was hired\nas a director by Columbia Pictures President and Production Chief\nHarry Cohn for $1,000. The event was\nmomentous for both of them, for at Columbia Capra would soon become the\n#1 director in Hollywood in the 1930s, and the success of Capra's films\nwould propel the Poverty Row studio into the major leagues. But at\nfirst, Cohn was displeased with him. When viewing the first three days\nof rushes of his first Columbia film,\nThat Certain Thing (1928),\nCohn wanted to fire him as everything on the first day had been shot in\nlong shot, on the second day in medium shot, and on the third day in\nclose-ups.\"I did it that way for time,\" Capra later recalled. \"It was so easy to\nbe better than the other directors, because they were all dopes. They\nwould shoot a long shot, then they would have to change the setup to\nshoot a medium shot, then they would take their close-ups. Then they\nwould come back and start over again. You lose time, you see, moving\nthe cameras and the big goddamn lights. I said, 'I'll get all the long\nshots on that first set first, then all the medium shots, and then the\nclose-ups.' I wouldn't shoot the whole scene each way unless it was\nnecessary. If I knew that part of it was going to play in long shot, I\nwouldn't shoot that part in close-up. But the trick was not to move\nnine times, just to move three times. This saved a day, maybe two\ndays.\"Cohn decided to stick with Capra (he was ultimately delighted at the\npicture and gave Capra a $1,500 bonus and upped his per-picture\nsalary), and in 1928, Cohn raised his salary again, now to to $3,000\nper picture after he made several successful pictures, including\nSubmarine (1928).\nThe Younger Generation (1929),\nthe first of a series of films with higher budgets to be directed by\nCapra, would prove to be his first sound film, when scenes were reshot\nfor dialogue. In the summer of that year, he was introduced to a young\nwidow, Lucille Warner Reyburn (who became Capra's second wife\nLou Capra). He also met a transplanted stage\nactress, Barbara Stanwyck, who had been\nrecruited for the talkie but had been in three successive unsuccessful\nfilms and wanted to return to the New York stage.\nHarry Cohn wanted Stanwyck to appear\nin Capra's planned film,\nLadies of Leisure (1930), but\nthe interview with Capra did not go well, and Capra refused to use her.Stanwyck went home crying after being dismissed by Capra, and her\nhusband, a furious Frank Fay, called Capra up.\nIn his defense, Capra said that Stanwyck didn't seem to want the part.\nAccording to Capra's 1961 autobiography, \"The Name Above the Title,\"\nFay said, \"Frank, she's young, and shy, and she's been kicked around\nout here. Let me show you a test she made at Warner's.\" After viewing\nher Warners' test for The Noose (1928),\nCapra became enthusiastic and urged Cohn to sign her. In January of\n1930, Capra began shooting\nLadies of Leisure (1930) with\nStanwyck in the lead. The movies the two made together in the early\n'30s established them both on their separate journeys towards becoming\nmovieland legends. Though Capra would admit to falling in love with his\nleading lady, it was Lucille Warner Reyburn who became the second Mrs.\nCapra.\"You're wondering why I was at that party. That's my racket. I'm a\nparty girl. Do you know what that is?\"Stanwyck played a working-class \"party girl\" hired as a model by the\npainter Jerry, who hails from a wealthy family. Capra had written the\nfirst draft of the movie before screenwriter\nJo Swerling took over. Swerling thought the\ntreatment was dreadful. According to Capra, Swerling told\nHarry Cohn, when he initially had\napproached about adapting the play \"Ladies of the Evening\" into Capra's\nnext proposed film, \"I don't like Hollywood, I don't like you, and I\ncertainly don't like this putrid piece of gorgonzola somebody gave me\nto read. It stunk when Belasco produced it as\nLadies of Leisure (1930), and\nit will stink as Ladies of Leisure, even if your little tin Jesus does\ndirect it. The script is inane, vacuous, pompous, unreal, unbelievable and incredibly dull.\"Capra, who favored extensive rehearsals before shooting a scene,\ndeveloped his mature directorial style while collaborating with\nStanwyck, a trained stage actress whose performance steadily\ndeteriorated after rehearsals or retakes. Stanwyck's first take in a\nscene usually was her best. Capra started blocking out scenes in\nadvance, and carefully preparing his other actors so that they could\nreact to Stanwyck in the first shot, whose acting often was\nunpredictable, so they wouldn't foul up the continuity. In response to\nthis semi-improvisatory style, Capra's crew had to boost its level of\ncraftsmanship to beyond normal Hollywood standards, which were forged\nin more static and prosaic work conditions. Thus, the professionalism\nof Capra's crews became better than those of other directors. Capra's\nphilosophy for his crew was, \"You guys are working for the actors,\nthey're not working for you.\"After \"Ladies of Leisure,\" Capra was assigned to direct\nPlatinum Blonde (1931) starring\nJean Harlow. The script had been the\nproduct of a series of writers, including\nJo Swerling (who was given credit for\nadaptation), but was polished by Capra and\nRobert Riskin (who was given\nscreen credit for the dialogue). Along with\nJo Swerling, Riskin would rank as one of\nCapra's most important collaborators, ultimately having a hand in 13\nmovies. (Riskin wrote nine screenplays for Capra, and Capra based four\nother films on Riskin's work.)Riskin created a hard-boiled newspaperman, Stew Smith for the film, a\ncharacter his widow, the actress Fay Wray, said\ncame closest to Riskin of any character he wrote. A comic character,\nthe wise-cracking reporter who wants to lampoon high society but finds\nhimself hostage to the pretensions of the rich he had previously mocked\nis the debut of the prototypical \"Capra\" hero. The dilemma faced by\nStew, akin to the immigrant's desire to assimilate but being rejected\nby established society, was repeated in\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)\nand in Meet John Doe (1941).Capra, Stanwyck, Riskin and Jo Swerling all\nwere together to create Capra's next picture,\nThe Miracle Woman (1931), a\nstory about a shady evangelist. With\nJohn Meehan, Riskin wrote the play\nthat the movie is based on, \"Bless You, Sister,\" and there is a\npossibly apocryphal story that has Riskin at a story conference at\nwhich Capra relates the treatment for the proposed film. Capra,\nfinished, asked Riskin for his input, and Riskin replied, \"I wrote that\nplay. My brother and I were stupid enough to produce it on Broadway. It\ncost us almost every cent we had. If you intend to make a picture of\nit, it only proves one thing: You're even more stupid than we were.\"Jo Swerling adapted Riskin's play, which he\nand his brother Everett patterned after\nSinclair Lewis' \"Elmer Gantry.\" Like the\nLewis novel, the play focuses on the relationship between a lady\nevangelist and a con man. The difference, though, is that the nature of\nthe relationship is just implied in Riskin's play (and the Capra film).\nThere is also the addition of the blind war-vet as the moral conscience\nof the story; he is the pivotal character, whereas in Lewis' tale, the\ncon artist comes to have complete control over the evangelist after\neventually seducing her. Like some other Capra films,\nThe Miracle Woman (1931) is\nabout the love between a romantic, idealizing man and a cynical, bitter\nwoman. Riskin had based his character on lady evangelist Uldine Utley,\nwhile Stanwyck based her characterization on\nAimee Semple McPherson.Recognizing that he had something in his star director,\nHarry Cohn took full advantage of the\nlowly position his studio had in Hollywood. Both Warner Brothers and\nmighty MGM habitually lent Cohn their troublesome stars -- anyone\nrejecting scripts or demanding a pay raise was fodder for a loan out to\nCohn's Poverty Row studio. Cohn himself was habitually loathe to sign\nlong-term stars in the early 1930s (although he made rare exceptions to\nPeter Lorre and\nThe Three Stooges) and was delighted\nto land the talents of any top flight star and invariably assigned them\nto Capra's pictures. Most began their tenure in purgatory with\ntrepidation but left eagerly wanting to work with Capra again.In 1932, Capra decided to make a motion picture that reflected the\nsocial conditions of the day. He and Riskin wrote the screenplay for\nAmerican Madness (1932), a\nmelodrama that is an important precursor to later Capra films, not only\nwith\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946)\nwhich shares the plot device of a bank run, but also in the depiction\nof the irrationality of a crowd mentality and the ability of the\nindividual to make a difference. In the movie, an idealistic banker is\nexcoriated by his conservative board of directors for making loans to\nsmall businesses on the basis of character rather than on sounder\nfinancial criteria. Since the Great Depression is on, and many people\nlack collateral, it would be impossible to productively lend money on\nany other criteria than character, the banker argues. When there is a\nrun on the bank due to a scandal, it appears that the board of\ndirectors are rights the bank depositors make a run on the bank to take\nout their money before the bank fails. The fear of a bank failure\nensures that the failure will become a reality as a crowd mentality\ntakes over among the clientèle. The board of directors refuse to pledge\ntheir capital to stave off the collapse of the bank, but the banker\nmakes a plea to the crowd, and just like George Bailey's depositors in\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946),\nthe bank is saved as the fears of the crowd are ameliorated and\nbusinessmen grateful to the banker pledge their capital to save the\nbank. The board of directors, impressed by the banker's character and\nhis belief in the character of his individual clients (as opposed to\nthe irrationality of the crowd), pledge their capital and the bank run\nis staved off and the bank is saved.In his biography, \"The Name Above the Picture,\" Capra wrote that before\nAmerican Madness (1932), he had\nonly made \"escapist\" pictures with no basis in reality. He recounts how\nPoverty Row studios, lacking stars and production values, had to resort\nto \"gimmick\" movies to pull the crowds in, making films on au courant\ncontroversial subjects that were equivalent to \"yellow journalism.\"What was more important than the subject and its handling was the\nmaturation of Capra's directorial style with the film. Capra had become\nconvinced that the mass-experience of watching a motion picture with an\naudience had the psychological effect in individual audience members of\nslowing down the pace of a film. A film that during shooting and then\nwhen viewed on a movieola editing device and on a small screen in a\nscreening room among a few professionals that had seemed normally paced\nbecame sluggish when projected on the big screen. While this could have\nbeen the result of the projection process blowing up the actors to such\nlarge proportions, Capra ultimately believed it was the effect of mass\npsychology affecting crowds since he also noticed this \"slowing down\"\nphenomenon at ball games and at political conventions. Since\nAmerican Madness (1932) dealt\nwith crowds, he feared that the effect would be magnified.He decided to boost the pace of the film, during the shooting. He did\naway with characters' entrances and exits that were a common part of\ncinematic \"grammar\" in the early 1930s, a survival of the \"photoplays\"\ndays. Instead, he \"jumped\" characters in and out of scenes, and\njettisoned the dissolves that were also part of cinematic grammar that\ntypically ended scenes and indicated changes in time or locale so as\nnot to make cutting between scenes seem choppy to the audience.\nDialogue was deliberately overlapped, a radical innovation in the early\ntalkies, when actors were instructed to let the other actor finish his\nor her lines completely before taking up their cue and beginning their\nown lines, in order to facilitate the editing of the sound-track. What\nhe felt was his greatest innovation was to boost the pacing of the\nacting in the film by a third by making a scene that would normally\nplay in one minute take only 40 seconds.When all these innovations were combined in his final cut, it made the\nmovie seem normally paced on the big screen, though while shooting\nindividual scenes, the pacing had seemed exaggerated. It also gave the\nfilm a sense of urgency that befitted the subject of a financial panic\nand a run on a bank. More importantly, it \"kept audience attention\nriveted to the screen,\" as he said in his autobiography. Except for\n\"mood pieces,\" Capra subsequently used these techniques in all his\nfilms, and he was amused by critics who commented on the \"naturalness\"\nof his direction.Capra was close to completely establishing his themes and style. Justly\naccused of indulging in sentiment which some critics labeled\n\"Capra-corn,\" Capra's next film,\nLady for a Day (1933) was an\nadaptation of Damon Runyon's 1929 short\nstory \"Madame La Gimp\" about a nearly destitute apple peddler whom the\nsuperstitious gambler Dave the Dude (portrayed by Warner Brothers star\nWarren William) sets up in high style so\nshe and her daughter, who is visiting with her finance, will not be\nembarrassed. Dave the Dude believes his luck at gambling comes from his\nritualistically buying an apple a day from Annie, who is distraught and\nconsidering suicide to avoid the shame of her daughter seeing her\nreduced to living on the street. The Dude and his criminal confederates\nput Annie up in a luxury apartment with a faux husband in order to\nestablish Annie in the eyes of her daughter as a dignified and\nrespectable woman, but in typical Runyon fashion, Annie becomes more\nthan a fake as the masquerade continues.Robert Riskin wrote the first four\ndrafts of Lady for a Day (1933),\nand of all the scripts he worked on for Capra, the film deviates less\nfrom the script than any other. After seeing the movie, Runyon sent a\ntelegraph to Riskin praising him for his success at elaborating on the\nstory and fleshing out the characters while maintain his basic story.\nLady for a Day (1933) was the\nfavorite Capra film of John Ford, the\ngreat filmmaker who once directed the unknown extra. The movie cost\n$300,000 and was the first of Capra's oeuvre to attract the attention\nof the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, getting a Best\nDirector nomination for Capra, plus nods for Riskin and Best Actress.\nThe movie received Columbia's first Best Picture nomination, the studio\nnever having attracted any attention from the Academy before\nLady for a Day (1933). (Capra's\nlast film was the flop remake of\nLady for a Day (1933) with\nBette Davis and\nGlenn Ford,\nPocketful of Miracles (1961))Capra reunited with Stanwyck and produced his first universally\nacknowledged classic,\nThe Bitter Tea of General Yen (1932),\na film that now seems to belong more to the oeuvre of\nJosef von Sternberg than it does to\nFrank Capra. With \"General Yen,\" Capra had consciously set out to make\na movie that would win Academy Awards. Frustrated that the innovative,\ntimely, and critically well-received\nAmerican Madness (1932) had not\nreceived any recognition at the Oscars (particularly in the director's\ncategory in recognition of his innovations in pacing), he vented his\ndispleasure to Columbia boss Cohn.\"Forget it,\" Cohn told Capra, as recounted in his autobiography. \"You\nain't got a Chinaman's chance. They only vote for that arty junk.\"Capra set out to boost his chances by making an arty film featuring a\n\"Chinaman\" that confronted that major taboo of American cinema of the\nfirst half of the century, miscegenation.In the movie, the American missionary Megan Davis is in China to marry\nanother missionary. Abducted by the Chinese Warlord General Yen, she is\ntorn away from the American compound that kept her isolated from the\nChinese and finds herself in a strange, dangerous culture. The two fall\nin love despite their different races and life-views. The film ran up\nagainst the taboo against miscegenation embedded in the Motion Picture\nProducers and Distributors Association's Production Code, and while\nMegan merely kisses General Yen's hand in the picture, the fact that\nshe was undeniably in love with a man from a different race attracted\nthe vituperation of many bigots.Having fallen for Megan, General Yen engenders her escape back to the\nAmericans before willingly drinking a poisoned cup of tea, his\ninvolvement with her having cost him his army, his wealth, and now his\ndesire to live.\nThe Bitter Tea of General Yen (1932)\nmarks the introduction of suicide as a Capra theme that will come back\nrepeatedly, most especially in George Bailey's breakdown on the snowy\nbridge in\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946).Despair often shows itself in Capra films, and although in his\npost-\"General Yen\" work, the final reel wraps things up in a happy way,\nuntil that final reel, there is tragedy, cynicism, heartless\nexploitation, and other grim subject matter that Capra's audiences must\nhave known were the truth of the world, but that were too grim to face\nwhen walking out of a movie theater. When pre-Code movies were\nrediscovered and showcased across the United States in the 1990s, they\nwere often accompanied by thesis about how contemporary audiences\n\"read\" the films (and post-1934 more Puritanical works), as the movies\nwere not so frank or racy as supposed. There was a great deal of\nsignaling going on which the audience could read into, and the same\nmust have been true for Capra's films, giving lie to the fact that he\nwas a sentimentalist with a saccharine view of America. There are few\nfilms as bitter as those of Frank Capra before the final reel.Despair was what befell Frank Capra, personally, on the night of March\n16, 1934, which he attended as one of the Best Director nominees for\nLady for a Day (1933). Capra had\ncaught Oscar fever, and in his own words, \"In the interim between the\nnominations and the final voting...my mind was on those Oscars.\" When\nOscar host Will Rogers opened the\nenvelope for Best Director, he commented, \"Well, well, well. What do\nyou know. I've watched this young man for a long time. Saw him come up\nfrom the bottom, and I mean the bottom. It couldn't have happened to a\nnicer guy. Come on up and get it, Frank!\"Capra got up to go get it, squeezing past tables and making his way to\nthe open dance floor to accept his Oscar. \"The spotlight searched\naround trying to find me.\n'Over here!' I waved. Then it suddenly swept\naway from me -- and picked up a flustered man standing on the other\nside of the dance floor -\nFrank Lloyd!\"Frank Lloyd went up to the dais to\naccept HIS Oscar while a voice in back of Capra yelled, \"Down in\nfront!\"Capra's walk back to his table amidst shouts of \"Sit down!\" turned into\nthe \"Longest, saddest, most shattering walk in my life. I wished I\ncould have crawled under the rug like a miserable worm. When I slumped\nin my chair I felt like one. All of my friends at the table were\ncrying.\"That night, after Lloyd's\nCavalcade (1933), beat\nLady for a Day (1933) for Best\nPicture, Capra got drunk at his house and passed out. \"Big 'stupido,'\"\nCapra thought to himself, \"running up to get an Oscar dying with\nexcitement, only to crawl back dying with shame. Those crummy Academy\nvoters; to hell with their lousy awards. If ever they did vote me one,\nI would never, never, NEVER show up to accept it.\"Capra would win his first of three Best Director Oscars the next year,\nand would show up to accept it. More importantly, he would become the\npresident of the Academy in 1935 and take it out of the labor relations\nfield a time when labor strife and the formation of the talent guilds\nthreatened to destroy it.The International Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences had been\nthe brainchild of Louis B. Mayer in 1927\n(it dropped the \"International\" soon after its formation). In order to\nforestall unionization by the creative talent (directors, actors and\nscreenwriters) who were not covered by the Basic Agreement signed in\n1926, Mayer had the idea of forming a company union, which is how the\nAcademy came into being. The nascent Screen Writers Union, which had\nbeen created in 1920 in Hollywood, had never succeeded in getting a\ncontract from the studios. It went out of existence in 1927, when labor\nrelations between writers and studios were handled by the Academy's\nwriters' branch.The Academy had brokered studio-mandated pay-cuts of 10% in 1927 and\n1931, and massive layoffs in 1930 and 1931. With the inauguration of\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt took no\ntime in attempting to tackle the Great Depression. The day after his\ninauguration, he declared a National Bank Holiday, which hurt the movie\nindustry as it was heavily dependent on bank loans.\nLouis B. Mayer, as president of the\nAssociation of Motion Picture Producers, Inc. (the co-equal arm of the\nMotion Picture Producers and Distributors Association charged with\nhandling labor relations) huddled with a group from the Academy (the\norganization he created and had long been criticized for dominating, in\nboth labor relations and during the awards season) and announced a 50%\nacross-the-board pay cut. In response, stagehands called a strike for\nMarch 13th, which shut down every studio in Hollywood.After another caucus between Mayer and the Academy committee, a\nproposal for a pay-cut on a sliding-scale up to 50% for everyone making\nover $50 a week; which would only last for eight weeks, was\ninaugurated. Screen writers resigned en masse from the Academy and\njoined a reformed Screen Writers Guild, but most employees had little\nchoice and went along with it. All the studios but Warner Bros. and Sam\nGoldwyn honored the pledge to restore full salaries after the eight\nweeks, and Warners production chief\nDarryl F. Zanuck resigned in protest\nover his studio's failure to honor its pledge. A time of bad feelings\npersisted, and much anger was directed towards the Academy in its role\nas company union.The Academy, trying to position itself as an independent arbiter, hired\nthe accounting firm of Price Waterhouse for the first time to inspect\nthe books of the studios. The audit revealed that all the studios were\nsolvent, but Harry Warner refused to budge and Academy President\n'Conrad Nagel' resigned, although some said he was forced out after a\nvote of no-confidence after arguing Warner's case. The Academy\nannounced that the studio bosses would never again try to impose a\nhorizontal salary cut, but the usefulness of the Academy as a company\nunion was over.Under Roosevelt's New Deal, the self-regulation imposed by the National\nIndustrial Relations Act (signed into law on June 16th) to bring\nbusiness sectors back to economic health was predicated upon\ncartelization, in which the industry itself wrote its own regulatory\ncode. With Hollywood, it meant the re-imposition of paternalistic labor\nrelations that the Academy had been created to wallpaper over. The last\nnail in the company union's coffin was when it became public knowledge\nthat the Academy appointed a committee to investigate the continued\nfeasibility of the industry practice of giving actors and writers\nlong-term contracts. High salaries to directors, actors, and screen\nwriters was compensation to the creative people for producers refusing\nto ceded control over creative decision-making. Long-term contracts\nwere the only stability in the Hollywood economic set-up up creative\npeople,. Up to 20%-25% of net earnings of the movie industry went to\nbonuses to studio owners, production chiefs, and senior executives at\nthe end of each year, and this created a good deal of resentment that\nfueled the militancy of the SWG and led to the formation of the Screen\nActors Guild in July 1933 when they, too, felt that the Academy had\nsold them out.The industry code instituted a cap on the salaries of actors,\ndirectors, and writers, but not of movie executives; mandated the\nlicensing of agents by producers; and created a reserve clause similar\nto baseball where studios had renewal options with talent with expired\ncontracts, who could only move to a new studio if the studio they had\nlast been signed to did not pick up their option.The SWG sent a telegram to FDR in October 1933 denouncing this policy,\narguing that the executives had taken millions of dollars of bonuses\nwhile running their companies into receivership and bankruptcy. The SWG\ndenounced the continued membership of executives who had led their\nstudios into financial failure remaining on the corporate boards and in\nthe management of the reorganized companies, and furthermore protested\ntheir use of the NIRA to write their corrupt and failed business\npractices into law at the expense of the workers.There was a mass resignation of actors from the Academy in October\n1933, with the actors switching their allegiance to SAG. SAG joined\nwith the SWG to publish \"The Screen Guilds Magazine,\" a periodical\nwhose editorial content attacked the Academy as a company union in the\nproducers' pocket. SAG President Eddie Cantor, a friend of Roosevelt\nwho had bee invited to spend the Thanksgiving Day holiday with the\npresident, informed him of the guild's grievances over the NIRA code.\nRoosevelt struck down many of the movie industry code's anti-labor\nprovisions by executive order.The labor battles between the guilds and the studios would continue\nuntil the late 1930s, and by the time Frank Capra was elected president\nof the Academy in 1935, the post was an unenviable one. The Screen\nDirectors Guild was formed at King Vidor's house on January 15, 1936,\nand one of its first acts was to send a letter to its members urging\nthem to boycott the Academy Awards ceremony, which was three days away.\nNone of the guilds had been recognized as bargaining agents by the\nstudios, and it was argued to grace the Academy Awards would give the\nAcademy, a company union, recognition. Academy membership had declined\nto 40 from a high of 600, and Capra believed that the guilds wanted to\npunish the studios financially by depriving them of the good publicity\nthe Oscars generated.But the studios couldn't care less. Seeing that the Academy was\nworthless to help them in its attempts to enforce wage cuts, it too\nabandoned the Academy, which it had financed. Capra and the Board\nmembers had to pay for the Oscar statuettes for the 1936 ceremony. In\norder to counter the boycott threat, Capra needed a good publicity\ngimmick himself, and the Academy came up with one, voting\nD.W. Griffith an honorary Oscar,\nthe first bestowed since one had been given to\nCharles Chaplin at the first Academy\nAwards ceremony.The Guilds believed the boycott had worked as only 20 SAG members and\n13 SWG members had showed up at the Oscars, but Capra remembered the\nnight as a victory as all the winners had shown up. However, 'Variety'\nwrote that \"there was not the galaxy of stars and celebs in the\ndirector and writer groups which distinguished awards banquets in\nrecent years.\" \"Variety\" reported that to boost attendance, tickets had\nbeen given to secretaries and the like.\nBette Davis and\nVictor McLaglen had showed up to accept\ntheir Oscars, but McLaglen's director and screenwriter,\nJohn Ford and\nDudley Nichols, both winners like\nMcLaglen for The Informer (1935),\nwere not there, and Nichols became the first person to refuse an\nAcademy Award when he sent back his statuette to the Academy with a\nnote saying he would not turn his back on his fellow writers in the\nSWG. Capra sent it back to him. Ford, the treasurer of the SDG, had not\nshowed up to accept his Oscar, he explained, because he wasn't a member\nof the Academy. When Capra staged a ceremony where Ford accepted his\naward, the SDG voted him out of office.To save the Academy and the Oscars, Capra convinced the board to get it\nout of the labor relations field. He also democratized the nomination\nprocess to eliminate studio politics, opened the cinematography and\ninterior decoration awards to films made outside the U.S., and created\ntwo new acting awards for supporting performances to win over SAG.By the 1937 awards ceremony, SAG signaled its pleasure that the Academy\nhad mostly stayed out of labor relations by announcing it had no\nobjection to its members attending the awards ceremony. The ceremony\nwas a success, despite the fact that the Academy had to charge\nadmission due to its poor finances. Frank Capra had saved the Academy\nof Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and he even won his second Oscar\nthat night, for directing\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936).\nAt the end of the evening, Capra announced the creation of the\nIrving Thalberg Memorial Award to honor\n\"the most consistent high level of production achievement by an\nindividual producer.\" It was an award he himself was not destined to\nwin.By the 1938 awards, the Academy and all three guilds had buried the\nhatchet, and the guild presidents all attended the ceremony: SWG\nPresident Dudley Nichols, who finally had\naccepted his Oscar, SAG President Robert Montgomery, and SDG President\nKing Vidor. Capra also had introduced the\nsecret ballot, the results of which were unknown to everyone but the\npress, who were informed just before the dinner so they could make\ntheir deadlines. The first Irving Thalberg Award was given to long-time\nAcademy supporter and anti-Guild stalwart\nDarryl F. Zanuck by\nCecil B. DeMille, who in his\npreparatory remarks, declared that the Academy was \"now free of all\nlabor struggles.\"But those struggles weren't over. In 1939, Capra had been voted\npresident of the SDG and began negotiating with AMPP President 'Joseph\nSchenck', the head of 20th Century-Fox, for the industry to recognize\nthe SDG as the sole collective bargaining agent for directors. When\nSchenck refused, Capra mobilized the directors and threatened a strike.\nHe also threatened to resign from the Academy and mount a boycott of\nthe awards ceremony, which was to be held a week later. Schenck gave\nin, and Capra won another victory when he was named Best Director for a\nthird time at the Academy Awards, and his movie,\nYou Can't Take It with You (1938),\nwas voted Best Picture of 1938.The 1940 awards ceremony was the last that Capra presided over, and he\ndirected a documentary about them, which was sold to Warner Bros' for\n$30,000, the monies going to the Academy. He was nominated himself for\nBest Director and Best Picture for\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939),\nbut lost to the\nGone with the Wind (1939)\njuggernaut. Under Capra's guidance, the Academy had left the labor\nrelations field behind in order to concentrated on the awards\n(publicity for the industry), research and education.\"I believe the guilds should more or less conduct the operations and\nfunctions of this institution,\" he said in his farewell speech. He\nwould be nominated for Best Director and Best Picture once more with\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946)\nin 1947, but the Academy would never again honor him, not even with an\nhonorary award after all his service.\n(Bob Hope, in contrast, received four\nhonorary awards, including a lifetime membership in 1945, and the Jean\nHersholt Humanitarian award in 1960 from the Academy.) The SDG\n(subsequently renamed the Directors Guild of America after its 1960\nwith the Radio and Television Directors Guild and which Capra served as\nits first president from 1960-61), the union he had struggled with in\nthe mid-1930s but which he had first served as president from 1939 to\n1941 and won it recognition, voted him a lifetime membership in 1941\nand a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1959.Whenever Capra convinced studio boss\nHarry Cohn to let him make movies\nwith more controversial or ambitious themes, the movies typically lost\nmoney after under-performing at the box office.\nThe Bitter Tea of General Yen (1932)\nand Lost Horizon (1937) were both\nexpensive, philosophically minded pictures that sought to reposition\nCapra and Columbia into the prestige end of the movie market. After the\nformer's relative failure at the box office and with critics, Capra\nturned to making a screwball comedy, a genre he excelled at, with\nIt Happened One Night (1934).\nBookended with\nYou Can't Take It with You (1938),\nthese two huge hits won Columbia Best Picture Oscars and Capra Best\nDirector Academy Awards. These films, along with\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936),\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939),\nand\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946)\nare the heart of Capra's cinematic canon. They are all classics and\nproducts of superb craftsmanship, but they gave rise to the canard of\n\"Capra-corn.\" One cannot consider Capra without taking into account\nThe Bitter Tea of General Yen (1932),\nAmerican Madness (1932), and\nMeet John Doe (1941), all three\ndark films tackling major issues, Imperialism, the American plutocracy,\nand domestic fascism. Capra was no Pollyanna, and the man who was\ncalled a \"dago\" by Mack Sennett and who\nwent on to become one of the most unique, highly honored and successful\ndirectors, whose depictions of America are considered Americana\nthemselves, did not live his cinematic life looking through a\nrose-colored range-finderIn his autobiography \"The Name Above the Title,\" Capra says that at the\ntime of American Madness (1932),\ncritics began commenting on his \"gee-whiz\" style of filmmaking. The\ncritics attacked \"gee whiz\" cultural artifacts as their fabricators\n\"wander about wide-eyed and breathless, seeing everything as larger\nthan life.\" Capra's response was \"Gee whiz!\"Defining Hollywood as split between two camps, \"Mr. Up-beat\" and \"Mr.\nDown-beat,\" Capra defended the up-beat gee whiz on the grounds that,\n\"To some of us, all that meets the eye IS larger than life, including\nlife itself. Who ca match the wonder of it?\"Among the artists of the \"Gee-Whiz:\" school were\nErnest Hemingway,\nHomer, and\nPaul Gauguin, a novelist who lived a heroic\nlife larger than life itself, a poet who limned the lives of gods and\nheroes, and a painter who created a mythic Tahiti, the Tahiti that he\nwanted to find. Capra pointed to Moses and the apostles as examples of\nmen who were larger than life. Capra was proud to be \"Mr. Up-beat\"\nrather than belong to \"the 'ashcan' school\" whose \"films depict life as\nan alley of cats clawing lids off garbage cans, and man as less noble\nthan a hyena. The 'ash-canners,' in turn, call us Pollyannas, mawkish\nsentimentalists, and corny happy-enders.\"What really moves Capra is that in America, there was room for both\nschools, that there was no government interference that kept him from\nmaking a film like\nAmerican Madness (1932). (While\nAmbassador to the Court of St. James,\nJoseph P. Kennedy had asked\nHarry Cohn to stop exporting\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\nto Europe as it portrayed American democracy so negatively.) About Mr.\nUp-beat and Mr-Downbeat and \"Mr. In-between,\" Capra says, \"We all\nrespect and admire each other because the great majority freely express\ntheir own individual artistry unfettered by subsidies or strictures\nfrom government, pressure groups, or ideologists.\"In the period 1934 to 1941, Capra the created the core of his canon\nwith the classics\nIt Happened One Night (1934),\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936),\nYou Can't Take It with You (1938),\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)\nand Meet John Doe (1941), wining\nthree Best Director Oscars in the process. Some cine-historians call\nCapra the great American propagandist, he was so effective in creating\nan indelible impression of America in the 1930s. \"Maybe there never was\nan America in the thirties,\"\nJohn Cassavetes was quoted as\nsaying. \"Maybe it was all Frank Capra.\"After the United States went to war in December 1941, Frank Capra\nrejoined the Army and became an actual propagandist. His \"Why We Fight\"\nseries of propaganda films were highly lauded for their remarkable\ncraftsmanship and were the best of the U.S. propaganda output during\nthe war. Capra's philosophy, which has been variously described as a\nkind of Christian socialism (his films frequently feature a male\nprotagonist who can be seen a Christ figure in a story about redemption\nemphasizing New Testament values) that is best understood as an\nexpression of humanism, made him an ideal propagandist. He loved his\nadopted country with the fervor of the immigrant who had realized the\nAmerican dream. One of his propaganda films,\nThe Negro Soldier (1944), is a\nmilestone in race relations.Capra, a genius in the manipulation of the first form of \"mass media,\"\nwas opposed to \"massism.\" The crowd in a Capra film is invariably\nwrong, and he comes down on the side of the individual, who can make a\ndifference in a society of free individuals. In an interview, Capra\nsaid he was against \"mass entertainment, mass production, mass\neducation, mass everything. Especially mass man. I was fighting for, in\na sense, the preservation of the liberty of the individual person\nagainst the mass.\"Capra had left Columbia after \"Mr. Smith\" and formed his own production\ncompany. After the war, he founded Liberty Films with\nJohn Ford and made his last\nmasterpiece,\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946).\nLiberty folded prior to its release (another Liberty film,\nWilliam Wyler's masterpiece,\nThe Best Years of Our Lives (1946)\nwas released through United Artists). Though Capra received his sixth\nOscar nomination as best director, the movie flopped at the box office,\nwhich is hard to believe now that the film is considered must-see\nviewing each Christmas. Capra's period of greatness was over, and after\nmaking three under-whelming films from 1948 to '51 (including a remake\nof his earlier\nBroadway Bill (1934)), Capra didn't\ndirect another picture for eight years, instead making a series of\nmemorable semi-comic science documentaries for television that became\nrequired viewing for most 1960's school kids. His last two movies,\nA Hole in the Head (1959) and\nPocketful of Miracles (1961)\nhis remake of\nLady for a Day (1933) did little\nto enhance his reputation.But a great reputation it was, and is. Capra's films withstood the test\nof time and continue to be as beloved as when they were embraced by the\nmovie-going \"masses\" in the 1930s. It was the craftsmanship: Capra was\nundeniably a master of his medium. The great English novelist Graham\nGreene, who supported himself as a film critic in the 1930s, loved\nCapra's films due to their sense of responsibility and of common life,\nand due to his connection with his audience. (Capra, according to the\n1938 \"Time\" article, believed that what he liked would be liked by\nmoviegoers). In his review of\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936),\nGreene elucidated the central theme of Capra's movies: \"Goodness and\nsimplicity manhandled in a deeply selfish and brutal world.\"But it was Capra's great mastery over film that was the key to his\nsuccess. Comparing Capra to Dickens in a not wholly flattering review\nof\nYou Can't Take It with You (1938),\nGreen found Capra \"a rather muddled and sentimental idealist who feels\n-- vaguely -- that something is wrong with the social system\" (807).\nCommenting on the improbable scene in which Grandpa Vanderhof persuades\nthe munitions magnate Anthony P. Kirby to give everything up and play\nthe harmonica, Greene stated:\"It sounds awful, but it isn't as awful as all that, for Capra has a\ntouch of genius with a camera: his screen always seems twice as big as\nother people's, and he cuts as brilliantly as Eisenstein (the climax\nwhen the big bad magnate takes up his harmonica is so exhilarating in\nits movement that you forget its absurdity). Humour and not wit is his\nline, a humor that shades off into whimsicality, and a kind of popular\npoetry which is apt to turn wistful. We may groan and blush as he cuts\nhis way remorselessly through all finer values to the fallible human\nheart, but infallibly he makes his appeal - to that great soft organ\nwith its unreliable goodness and easy melancholy and baseless optimism.\nThe cinema, a popular craft, can hardly be expected to do more.\"Capra was a populist, and the simplicity of his narrative structures,\nin which the great social problems facing America were boiled down to\nscenarios in which metaphorical boy scouts took on corrupt political\nbosses and evil-minded industrialists, created mythical America of\nsimple archetypes that with its humor, created powerful films that\nappealed to the elemental emotions of the audience. The immigrant who\nhad struggled and been humiliated but persevere due to his inner\nresolution harnessed the mytho-poetic power of the movie to create\nproletarian passion plays that appealed to the psyche of the New Deal\nmovie-goer. The country during the Depression was down but not out, and\nthe ultimate success of the individual in the Capra films was a bracing\ntonic for the movie audience of the 1930s. His own personal history,\ntransformed on the screen, became their myths that got them through the\nDepression, and when that and the war was over, the great filmmaker\nfound himself out of time. Capra, like\nCharles Dickens, moralized political and\neconomic issues. Both were primarily masters of personal and moral\nexpression, and not of the social and political. It was the emotional\nrealism, not the social realism, of such films as\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939),\nwhich he was concerned with, and by focusing on the emotional and moral\nissues his protagonists faced, typically dramatized as a conflict\nbetween cynicism and the protagonist's faith and idealism, that made\nthe movies so powerful, and made them register so powerfully with an\naudience.",

        "bio": "Tom Sizemore rose in prominence throughout the 1990s, establishing\nhimself as a memorable tough-guy actor, sought by the most respected\ndirectors in the business.Thomas Edward Sizemore, Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Judith\n(Schannault), an ombudsman staff member, and Thomas Edward Sizemore,\nSr., a lawyer and professor. Sizemore grew up idolizing the tough-guy\ncharacters of the movies he watched. After attending Wayne State\nUniversity, he got his master's degree in theatre from Temple\nUniversity in 1986.Like many, he moved to New York City and struggled, waiting tables and\nperforming in plays. His first break came when\nOliver Stone cast him in a bit part\nin\nBorn on the Fourth of July (1989).\nBigger roles soon followed throughout the early 1990s, such as\nGuilty by Suspicion (1991),\nTrue Romance (1993), and\nStriking Distance (1993). 1994\nproved to be an even bigger year for Sizemore, as he won the role of\n\"Bat Masterson\" in Kevin Costner's\nstar-studded biopic Wyatt Earp (1994),\nas well as one of his first truly memorable roles as \"Detective Jack\nScagnetti\" in Oliver Stone's\ncontroversial\nNatural Born Killers (1994).\nIn 1995 he appeared in\nDevil in a Blue Dress (1995),\nStrange Days (1995), as well as the\nacclaimed crime epic Heat (1995), directed\nby Michael Mann. Sizemore's first\nbig leading role is in\nThe Relic (1997), the big-budget\neffects thriller directed by Peter Hyams.According to a 2001 interview in The Calgary Sun, Sizemore entered a\ndrug rehabilitation program in 1998 after his mother and his friend\nRobert De Niro appeared on his door-step\nduring the filming of\nWitness to the Mob (1998).\nTelling him they were there to drive him to jail or to rehabilitation,\nSizemore chose the latter. After completing rehabilitation, he\ncounseled adolescents involved in substance abuse.Offered roles in W.W.II films directed by both\nTerrence Malick and\nSteven Spielberg, Sizemore chose the\nrole of \"Sergeant Horvath\" in\nSaving Private Ryan (1998).\nThe role and film received wide acclaim and introduced Sizemore's\ntalents to a much broader audience in a more human and well-rounded\nrole than he had previously been given. Sizemore also credits this\nshoot and Steven Spielberg for helping\nhim with his recovery from addiction, with\nSteven Spielberg threatening to re-shoot\nthe entire film if Sizemore failed a drug test even once.After a flamboyant and uncredited mobster role in\nEnemy of the State (1998),\nSizemore then portrayed a psychotic paramedic in\nBringing Out the Dead (1999)\ndirected by Martin Scorsese. Seemingly\ntaking it easy, he then turned in fine but stereotypical performances\nin\nPlay It to the Bone (1999),\nRed Planet (2000), and\nPearl Harbor (2001). Sizemore then\nreceived another leading role in the high-profile military drama\nBlack Hawk Down (2001) directed\nby yet another legendary director,\nRidley Scott.Specializing in the sort of ultimate tough-guy/manly man roles that\nhearken back to a different era in film, Sizemore continued to be a\nfavorite of Hollywood's greatest directors. Never afraid to speak his\nmind about anyone and anything, his sense of blunt honesty and lack of\npretension was refreshing. A commanding voice and presence on film,\nSizemore looked to continue as one of Hollywood's greatest actors,\nuntil his untimely death from a brain aneurysm on March 3, 2023.",

        "bio": "Few actors in the world have had a career quite as diverse as Leonardo DiCaprio's. DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Growing Pains (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and The New Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Growing Pains (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Growing Pains (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.Leonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), a young gunslinger in The Quick and the Dead (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.In 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors.In 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).DiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.",

At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for El Pollo Loco.Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This led to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) & Cool World (1992).But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role.Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as an action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence.He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Peña.Pitt and Jolie have 6 children, 3 adopted & 3 biological.",

        "bio": "Critically hailed for his forceful, militant, authoritative figures and one of Hollywood's most talented and versatile performers, Laurence (John) Fishburne III has been the recipient of numerous awards, including a number of NAACP Image honors.Born in Augusta, Georgia on July 30, 1961, to Hattie Bell (Crawford), a teacher, and Laurence John Fishburne, Jr., a juvenile corrections officer. His mother transplanted her family to Brooklyn after his parents divorced. At the age of 10, the young boy appeared in his first play, \"In My Many Names and Days,\" at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting.In 1973, at the age of 12, young Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap One Life to Live (1968) that lasted three seasons. He subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). At 14 Francis Ford Coppola cast him in Apocalypse Now (1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn't work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in Rumble Fish (1983), The Cotton Club (1984) and Gardens of Stone (1987).Throughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. TV guest appearances at this time included \"Trapper John,\" \"M*A*S*H*,\" \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Miami Vice,\" \"Spenser: For Hire\" and \"The Equalizer.\"With the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in John Singleton's urban tale Boyz n the Hood (1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA's turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film.On stage, Laurence would become invariably linked to playwright August Wilson and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in \"Two Training Running.\" For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as \"Laurence\" instead of \"Larry.\" More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series \"Tribeca,\" he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies The Tuskegee Airmen (1995) and Miss Evers' Boys (1997).On the larger screen, both Laurence and Angela Bassett were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and\nTina Turner in the film What's Love Got to Do with It (1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, Keanu Reeves' mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi The Matrix (1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels.Into the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in Once in the Life (2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play \"Riff Raff,\" which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of \"The Lion in Winter\" as Henry II opposite Stockard Channing's Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993); a military prisoner in Cadence (1990); a college professor in Singleton's Higher Learning (1995); a CIA operative in Bad Company (1995); the title role in Othello (1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror Event Horizon (1997); a Depression-era gangster in Hoodlum (1997); a dogged police sergeant in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003); a spelling bee coach in Akeelah and the Bee (2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream films Predators (2010) and Contagion (2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show \"Thurgood\" and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later\ntransferred to the TV screen and earned an Emmy nomination.In the fall of 2008, Fishburne replaced William Petersen as the male lead investigator on the popular CBS drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced by Ted Danson. Having since had a regular role as \"Pops\" in the comedy Black-ish (2014), he has also been seen on the bigger screen in the Superman movies Man of Steel (2013) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) as Daily Planet chief Perry White; played a hired assassin in the thriller Standoff (2016); portrayed a minister and former Vietnam War vet in Last Flag Flying (2017); and essayed the role of a revengeful prison warden in Imprisoned (2018).Fishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress Hajna O. Moss. In September 2002, Fishburne married Cuban-American actress Gina Torres.",

        "bio": "Helena Bonham Carter is an actress of great versatility, one of the UK's finest and most successful.Bonham Carter was born May 26, 1966 in Golders Green, London, England, the youngest of three children of Elena (née Propper de Callejón), a psychotherapist, and Raymond Bonham Carter, a merchant banker. Through her father, she is the great-granddaughter of former Prime Minister Herbert H. Asquith, and her blue-blooded family tree also contains Barons and Baronesses, diplomats, and a director, Bonham Carter's great-uncle Anthony Asquith, who made Pygmalion (1938) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), among others. Cousin Crispin Bonham-Carter is also an actor. Her maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was a Spanish diplomat who was awarded the honorific Righteous Among the Nations, by Israel, for helping save Jews during World War II (Eduardo's own father was a Czech Jew). Helena's maternal grandmother, Hélène Fould-Springer, was from an upper-class Jewish family from France, Austria, and Germany, and later converted to her husband's Catholic faith.Bonham Carter experienced family dramas during her childhood, including her father's stroke - which left him wheelchair-bound. She attended South Hampstead High School and Westminster School in London, and subsequently devoted herself to an acting career. That trajectory actually began in 1979 when, at age thirteen, she entered a national poetry writing competition and used her second place winnings to place her photo in the casting directory \"Spotlight.\" She soon had her first agent and her first acting job, in a commercial, at age sixteen. She then landed a role in the made-for-TV movie A Pattern of Roses (1983), which subsequently led to her casting in the Merchant Ivory films A Room with a View (1985), director James Ivory's tasteful adaptation of E.M. Forster's novel, and Lady Jane (1986), giving a strong performance as the uncrowned Queen of England. She had roles in three other productions under the Merchant-Ivory banner (director Ivory, producer Ismail Merchant, and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala): an uncredited appearance in Maurice (1987), and large roles in Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991) and Howards End (1992).Often referred to as the \"corset queen\" or \"English rose\" because of her early work, Bonham Carter continued to surprise audiences with magnificent performances in a variety of roles from her more traditional corset-clad character in The Wings of the Dove (1997) and Shakespearian damsels to the dark and neurotic anti-heroines of Fight Club (1999). Her acclaimed performance in The Wings of the Dove (1997) earned her a Best Actress Academy Award nomination, a Golden Globe Best Actress nomination, a BAFTA Best Actress nomination, and a SAG Awards Best Actress nomination. It also won her a Best Actress Award from the National Board of Review, the Los Angeles Film Critics, the Boston Society Film Critics, the Broadcast Film Critics Association, the Texas Society of Film Critics, and the Southeastern Film Critics Association.In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late '90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson's Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass' The Theory of Flight (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn's Twelfth Night (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his Mighty Aphrodite (1995); Mort Ransen's Margaret's Museum (1995); Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet (1990).Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O'Sullivan's The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch.In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two-parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann's Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson's junkie fiancée, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall's heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White.Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton's film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton's massive hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton's spooky Corpse Bride (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart.After their meeting while filming Planet of the Apes (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton made seven films together. They lived in adjoining residences in London, shared a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, born in 2003, and Nell Burton, who was born in 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.",

He\nwas born into a prominent theatrical family on October 26, 1875 in\nLondon. His father was Charles Warner, and his grandfather was James\nWarner, both prominent English actors. He replaced\nJ.B. Warner as Jesus in\nThe King of Kings (1927) when\nJ.B. died of tuberculosis at age 29. (J.B. was not Henry's brother.\nJ.B. had taken the professional last name \"Warner\" because Henry's\nfamily took him in.)Henry Warner's family wanted him to become a doctor, and he graduated\nfrom London University but eventually gave up his medical studies. The\ntheater was in his blood, and he studied acting in Paris and Italy\nbefore joining his father's stock company, making his debut in the\nEnglish production of \"Drink.\" It was from his father that he honed his\ncraft.Warner made it to the United States in the early 1900s, after touring the British\nEmpire. Billed as Harry Warner, he made his Broadway debut in the\nUS colonial drama \"Audrey\" at Hoyt's Theatre on November 24,\n1902, starring James O'Neill, the father\nof playwright Eugene O'Neill. He was\nbilled as H.B. Warner in his next appearance on Broadway, in the 1906\ncomedy \"Nurse Marjorie.\" He appeared in 13 more Broadway productions in\nhis career, from the twin-bill of \"Susan in Search of a Husband\" & \"A\nTenement Tragedy\" (also 1906) to \"Silence\" in 1925.He moved into motion pictures, making his debut in the Mutual short\nHarp of Tara (1914). Also in 1914,\nhe appeared in a film written by\nCecil B. DeMille for Famous Players\nLasky,\nThe Ghost Breaker (1914), in\nwhich he had played on Broadway the year before.

        "bio": "Born into a military family in Huntsville, Alabama -- his father was an army vet who had served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, while his mother held a somewhat mysterious job in the Department of Defence -- Reg E. Cathey spent much of his early childhood living on a rural farmhouse in Germany. There, he watched American TV shows dubbed into German and first became theatre-struck at the age of nine after attending a USO performance of \"Guys and Dolls\". That same year, he also took up playing the saxophone. That he became an actor and not a jazz musician was happenstance, but, as he once admitted \"he was no Lester Young\". An incisive and eloquent personality with a uniquely expressive baritone voice, Cathey was to bring a soulful dignity and often unexpected sense of humour to a wide variety of roles on both stage and screen.Cathey attended the University of Michigan and later studied acting at the Yale School of Drama. The theatre remained his lifelong passion and New York his preferred place of residence. As he later explained: \"I learned how to act at Yale but learned how to be an actor in NYC. I escaped wandering lost in the desert that is Los Angeles after a decade (which I'll never get back) and being psychically traumatized, I didn't audition for film and television, immersing myself in the 'Classics.'\" And so, Cathey went on to tackle diverse (non-stereotypical) roles, ranging from Prospero in a musical version of Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' to 'Red' Redding in a British production of 'The Shawshank Redemption' (a part made famous by Morgan Freeman in the film version).Though performing more often than not in New York, Cathey did ultimately return to Hollywood. His formidable screen characters have often been marked by a uniquely erudite fierceness. They have included powerful authority figures, scientists and occasional villains in films (The Mask (1994), Tank Girl (1995), Se7en (1995), Fantastic Four (2015)) and shows like The Wire (2002), Outcast (2016) and House of Cards (2013) (his recurring role as Freddy Hayes, owner of Frank Underwood's favourite BBQ joint and secret hangout, which won him an Emmy Award in 2015 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series). In keeping with his credo that \"the dark stuff is fun\", he also proved excellent value as a shadowy keeper of secrets ('The Caretaker') in an episode of The Blacklist (2013) and as the top-hatted zombie master Baron Samedi, in an episode of Grimm (2011). One of his most poignant roles came near the end as the estranged father of Luke Cage (2016). Not long after, Reg E. Cathey passed away as a result of lung cancer in February 2018 at the untimely age of just 59, never having had the chance of fulfilling his longstanding ambition to play a baritone saxophonist.",

        "bio": "Liam Neeson was born on June 7, 1952 in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, to Katherine (Brown), a cook, and Bernard Neeson, a school caretaker. He was raised in a Catholic household. During his early years, Liam worked as a forklift operator for Guinness, a truck driver, an assistant architect and an amateur boxer. He had originally sought a career as a teacher by attending St. Mary's Teaching College, Newcastle. However, in 1976, Neeson joined the Belfast Lyric Players' Theater and made his professional acting debut in the play \"The Risen People\". After two years, Neeson moved to Dublin's Abbey Theater where he performed the classics. It was here that he was spotted by director John Boorman and was cast in the film Excalibur (1981) as Sir Gawain, his first high-profile film role.Through the 1980s Neeson appeared in a handful of films and British TV series - including The Bounty (1984), A Woman of Substance (1984),\nThe Mission (1986), and Duet for One (1986) - but it was not until he moved to Hollywood to pursue larger roles that he began to get noticed. His turn as a mute homeless man in Suspect (1987) garnered good reviews, as did supporting roles in The Good Mother (1988) and High Spirits (1988) - though he also starred in the best-to-be-forgotten Satisfaction (1988), which also featured a then-unknown Julia Roberts - but leading man status eluded him until the cult favorite Darkman (1990), directed by Sam Raimi. From there, Neeson starred in Under Suspicion (1991) and Ethan Frome (1992), was hailed for his performance in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives (1992), and ultimately was picked by Steven Spielberg to play Oskar Schindler in Schindler's List (1993). The starring role in the Oscar-winning Holocaust film brought Neeson Academy Award, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor.Also in 1993, he made his Broadway debut with a Tony-nominated performance in \"Anna Christie\", in which he co-starred with his future wife Natasha Richardson. The next year, the two also starred opposite Jodie Foster in the movie Nell (1994), and were married in July of that year. Leading roles as the 18th century Scottish Highlander Rob Roy (1995) and the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins (1996) followed, and soon Neeson was solidified as one of Hollywood's top leading men. He starred in the highly-anticipated Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) as Qui-Gon Jinn, received a Golden Globe nomination for Kinsey (2004), played the mysterious Ducard in Christopher Nolan's\nBatman Begins (2005), and provided the voice for Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005).Neeson found a second surprise career as an action leading man with the release of Taken (2008) in early 2009, an unexpected box office hit about a retired CIA agent attempting to rescue his daughter from being sold into prostitution. However, less than two months after the release of the film, tragedy struck when his wife Natasha Richardson suffered a fatal head injury while skiing and passed away days afterward. Neeson returned to high-profile roles in 2010 with two back-to-back big-budget films, Clash of the Titans (2010) and The A-Team (2010), and returned to the action genre with Unknown (2011), The Grey (2011), Battleship (2012) and Taken 2 (2012), as well as the sequel Wrath of the Titans (2012).Neeson was awarded Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the\n1999 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama. He has two sons from his marriage to Richardson: Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson (born June 22, 1995) and Daniel Jack Neeson (born August 27, 1996).",

Cazale made only five feature films in his career, which fans and critics alike call classics. But before his film debut, in the short The American Way (1962), he won Obie Awards for his off-Broadway performances in \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\" and \"The Line\".Cazale scored the role of Fredo Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), after his long-time friend, Al Pacino, invited him to audition. He reprised his role as the troubled Fredo in The Godfather Part II (1974), where his character endures one of the most infamous movie moments in the history of cinema.Cazale also starred with Gene Hackman and Harrison Ford in the thriller, The Conversation (1974), as Hackman's assistant, Stan. The Godfather's director, Francis Ford Coppola, also directed the movie.Cazale's fourth feature film, Dog Day Afternoon (1975), earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Sal, a bank robber. His long-time friend and Godfather costar, Al Pacino, played his partner, Sonny.His final film, The Deer Hunter (1978), was filmed whilst he was ill with cancer. He was in a relationship with his costar, Meryl Streep, whilst filming The Deer Hunter (1978), whom he met when they both appeared in the New York Public Theater's 1976 production of Shakespeare's Measure for Measure.Controversy occurred during the filming. While the studio was unaware of his condition, the director, Michael Cimino, knew about it. As Cazale was evidently weak, he was forced to film his scenes first. When the studio discovered he was suffering from cancer, they wanted him removed from the film. His costar and girlfriend, Meryl Streep, threatened to quit if he was\nfired. He died shortly after filming was completed.",

        "bio": "Michael Caine was born as Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in London, to Ellen (née Burchell), a cook, and Maurice Micklewhite Sr., a fish-market porter. He had a younger brother, Stanley Caine, and an older maternal half-brother named David Burchell. He left school at age 15 and took a series of working-class jobs before joining the British army and serving in Korea during the Korean War, where he saw combat. Upon his return to England, he gravitated toward the theater and got a job as an assistant stage manager. He adopted the name of Caine on the advice of his agent, taking it from a marquee that advertised The Caine Mutiny (1954). In the years that followed, he worked in more than 100 television dramas, with repertory companies throughout England and eventually in the stage hit \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\".Zulu (1964), the epic retelling of a historic 19th-century battle in South Africa between British soldiers and Zulu warriors, brought Caine to international attention. Instead of being typecast as a low-ranking Cockney soldier, he played a snobbish, aristocratic officer. Although \"Zulu\" was a major success, it was the role of Harry Palmer in The Ipcress File (1965) and the title role in Alfie (1966) that made Caine a star of the first magnitude. He epitomized the new breed of actor in mid-1960s England, the working-class bloke with glasses and a down-home accent. However, after initially starring in some excellent films, particularly in the 1960s, including Gambit (1966), Funeral in Berlin (1966), Play Dirty (1969), Battle of Britain (1969), Too Late the Hero (1970), The Last Valley (1971) and especially Get Carter (1971), he seemed to take on roles in below-average films, simply for the money he could by then command.However, there were some gems amongst the dross. He gave a magnificent performance opposite Sean Connery in The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and turned in a solid one as a German colonel in The Eagle Has Landed (1976). Educating Rita (1983), Blame It on Rio (1984) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (for which he won his first Oscar) were highlights of the 1980s, while more recently Little Voice (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999) (his second Oscar) and Last Orders (2001) have been widely acclaimed. Caine played Nigel Powers in the parody sequel Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002), and Alfred Pennyworth in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. He appeared in several other of Nolan's films including The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010) and Interstellar (2014). He also appeared as a supporting character in Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men (2006) and Pixar's sequel Cars 2 (2011).As of 2015, films in which Caine has starred have grossed over $7.4 billion worldwide. He is ranked the ninth highest grossing box office star. Caine is one of several actors nominated for an Academy Award for acting every decade from five consecutive decades (the other being Laurence Olivier and Meryl Streep). He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1992 Birthday Honours, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2000 Birthday Honours in recognition for his contributions to the cinema.Caine has been married twice. First to actress Patricia Haines from 1954 to 1958. They had a daughter, Dominique, in 1957. A bachelor for some dozen-plus years after the divorce, he was romantically linked to Edina Ronay (for three years), Elizabeth Ercy, Nancy Sinatra, Natalie Wood, Candice Bergen, Bianca Jagger, Françoise Pascal and Jill St. John. In 1971 he met his second wife, fashion model Shakira Caine (née Baksh), and they married in 1973, six months before their daughter Natasha was born. The couple has three grandchildren, and in 2023, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.",

        "bio": "With his breakthrough performance as Eames in Christopher Nolan's sci-fi thriller Inception (2010), English actor Tom Hardy has been brought to the attention of mainstream audiences worldwide. However, the versatile actor has been steadily working on both stage and screen since his television debut in the miniseries Band of Brothers (2001). After being cast in the World War II drama, Hardy left his studies at the prestigious Drama Centre in London and was subsequently cast as Twombly in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) and as the villain Shinzon in Star Trek: Nemesis (2002).Edward Thomas Hardy was born on September 15, 1977 in Hammersmith, London; his mother, Elizabeth Anne (Barrett), is an artist and painter, and his father, Chips Hardy, is a writer. He is of English and Irish descent. Hardy was brought up in East Sheen, London, and first studied at Reed's School. His education continued at Tower House School, then at Richmond Drama School, and subsequently at the Drama Centre London, along with fellow Oscar nominee Michael Fassbender. After winning a modeling competition at age 21, he had a brief contract with the agency Models One.Tom spent his teens and early twenties battling delinquency, alcoholism and drug addiction; after completing his work on Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), he sought treatment and has also admitted that his battles with addiction ended his five-year marriage to Sarah Ward. Returning to work in 2003, Hardy was awarded the Evening Standard Most Promising Newcomer Award for his theatre performances in the productions of \"In Arabia, We'd All Be Kings\" and \"Blood\". In 2003, Tom also co-starred in the play \"The Modernists\" with Paul Popplewell, Jesse Spencer and Orlando Wells.During the next five years, Hardy worked consistently in film, television and theatre, playing roles as varied as Robert Dudley in the BBC's The Virgin Queen (2005), Bill Sikes in Oliver Twist (2007) and starring in \"The Man of Mode\" at the National Theatre. On the silver screen, he appeared in the crime thriller Layer Cake (2004) with Daniel Craig, Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006), and the romp Scenes of a Sexual Nature (2006).In 2006, Hardy created \"Shotgun\", an underground theatre company along with director Robert Delamere, and directed a play, penned by his father for the company, called \"Blue on Blue\". In 2007, Hardy received a best actor BAFTA nomination for his touching performance as Stuart Shorter in the BBC adaptation of Alexander Masters' bestselling biography Stuart: A Life Backwards (2007). Hailed for his transformative character acting, Hardy was lauded for his emotionally and physically convincing portrayal in the ill-fated and warmhearted tale of Shorter, a homeless and occasionally violent man suffering from addiction and muscular dystrophy.The following year, he appeared as gay hoodlum Handsome Bob in the Guy Ritchie film RocknRolla (2008), but this would be his next transformation that would prove his extensive range and stun critics. In the film Bronson (2008), Hardy played the notorious Charles Bronson (given name, Michael Peterson), the \"most violent prisoner in Britain\". Bald, pumped-up, and outfitted with Bronson's signature strongman mustache, Hardy is unrecognizable and gives a harrowing performance that is physically fearless and psychologically unsettling. Director Nicolas Winding Refn breaks the fourth wall with Hardy retelling his tales directly to viewers as well as performing them outright before an audience of his own imagining. The performance mixes terrifying brutality, vaudevillian showmanship, wry humor, and an alarming amount of commitment, and won Hardy a British Independent Film Award for Best Actor. The performance got Hollywood's attention, and in 2009, Hardy was named one of Variety's \"10 Actors to Watch\". That year, he continued to garner praise for his starring role in The Take (2009), a four-part adaptation of Martina Cole's bestselling crime novel, as well as for his performance as Heathcliff in a version of Wuthering Heights (2009).Recent work includes the aforementioned breakthrough appearance in Inception (2010) alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard and Elliot Page. The movie was released in July 2010 and became one of top 25 highest grossing films of all time, collecting eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and winning four.Other films include Warrior (2011), opposite Joel Edgerton, the story of two estranged brothers facing the fight of a lifetime from director Gavin O'Connor, and This Means War (2012), directed by McG and co-starring Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. Tom also starred in the heralded Cold War thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) with Colin Firth and Gary Oldman. Hardy rejoined Christopher Nolan for The Dark Knight Rises (2012); he played the villain role of Bane opposite Christian Bale, Anne Hathaway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gary Oldman. Hardy's menacing physique and his character's scrambled, hard-to-distinguish voice became a major discussion point as the film was released.Outside of performing, Hardy is the patron for the charity \"Flack\", which is an organization to aid the recovery of the homeless in Cambridge. And in 2010, Hardy was named an Ambassador for The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged youth. On the recent stage, he starred in the Brett C. Leonard play \"The Long Red Road\" in early 2010. Written for Hardy and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, the play was staged at Chicago's Goodman Theater.In 2015, Hardy starred as the iconic Mad Max in George Miller's reboot of his franchise, Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). He also collected a British Independent Film Award for his portrayal of both the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie, in Legend (2015), and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as John Fitzgerald in The Revenant (2015). Hardy also starred on the BBC series Peaky Blinders (2013), alongside Cillian Murphy, and on the television series Taboo (2017), both created by Steven Knight.He has an outlaw biker story among other projects in development. In 2010, Hardy became engaged to fellow English actress Charlotte Riley, whom he starred with in The Take (2009) and Wuthering Heights (2009), and is raising a young son, Louis Thomas Hardy, with ex-girlfriend Rachael Speed. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours for his services to drama.",

        "bio": "Cate Blanchett was born on May 14, 1969 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, to June (Gamble), an Australian teacher and property developer, and Robert DeWitt Blanchett, Jr., an American advertising executive, originally from Texas. She has an older brother and a younger sister. When she was ten years old, her 40-year-old father died of a sudden heart attack. Her mother never remarried, and her grandmother moved in to help her mother.Cate graduated from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 1992 and, in a little over a year, had won both critical and popular acclaim. On graduating from NIDA, she joined the Sydney Theatre Company's production of Caryl Churchill's \"Top Girls\", then played Felice Bauer, the bride, in Tim Daly's \"Kafka Dances\", winning the 1993 Newcomer Award from the Sydney Theatre Critics Circle for her performance. From there, Blanchett moved to the role of Carol in David Mamet's searing polemic \"Oleanna\", also for the Sydney Theatre Company, and won the Rosemont Best Actress Award, her second award that year. She then co-starred in the ABC Television's prime time drama Heartland (1994), again winning critical acclaim. In 1995, she was nominated for Best Female Performance for her role as Ophelia in the Belvoir Street Theatre Company's production of \"Hamlet\". Other theatre credits include Helen in the Sydney Theatre Company's \"Sweet Phoebe\", Miranda in \"The Tempest\" and Rose in \"The Blind Giant is Dancing\", both for the Belvoir Street Theatre Company. In other television roles, Blanchett starred as Bianca in ABC's Bordertown (1995), as Janie Morris in G.P. (1989) and in ABC's popular series Police Rescue (1994). She made her feature film debut in Paradise Road (1997).Cate married writer Andrew Upton in 1997. She had met him a year earlier on a movie set, and they didn't like each other at first. He thought she was aloof, and she thought he was arrogant, but then they connected over a poker game at a party, and she went home with him that night. Three weeks later he proposed marriage and they quickly married before she went off to England to play her breakthrough role in films: the title character in Elizabeth (1998) for which she won numerous awards for her performance, including the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. Cate was also nominated for an Academy Award for the role but lost out to Gwyneth Paltrow. 2001 was a particularly busy year, with starring roles in Bandits (2001), The Shipping News (2001), Charlotte Gray (2001) and playing Elf Queen Galadriel in the \"Lord Of The Rings\" trilogy. She also gave birth to her first child, son Dashiell, in 2001. In 2004, she gave birth to her second son Roman.Also, in 2004, she played actress Katharine Hepburn in Martin Scorsese's film The Aviator (2004), for which she received an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress. Two years later, she received an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for playing a teacher having an affair with an underage student in Notes on a Scandal (2006). In 2007, she returned to the role that made her a star in Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007). It earned her an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. She was nominated for another Oscar that same year as Best Supporting Actress for playing Bob Dylan in I'm Not There (2007). In 2008, she gave birth to her third child, son Ignatius. She and her husband became artistic directors of the Sydney Theatre Company, choosing to spend more time in Australia raising their three sons. She also purchased a multi-million dollar home in Sydney, Australia and named it Bulwarra and made extensive renovations to it. Because of her life in Australia, her film work became sporadic, until Woody Allen cast her in the title role in Blue Jasmine (2013), which won her the Academy Award as Best Actress. She ended her job as artistic director of the Sydney Theatre Company, while her husband continued there for two more years before he too resigned.In 2015, she adopted her daughter Edith in her father's homeland of the United States. That same year, she and her husband sold their multi-million dollar home in Australia at a profit and moved to America. Reasons varied from her wanting to work more in America to wanting to familiarize herself with her late father's American heritage. She played the title role of Carol (2015), a 1950s American housewife in a lesbian affair with a younger woman, for which she received an Oscar nomination as Best Actress. While most actresses might slow down in their forties, Blanchett did the opposite by stretching her boundaries even further, such as when she played 13 different characters in Manifesto (2015) and then making her Broadway debut in 2017 in \"The Present\", which is her husband's adaptation of Chekhov's play \"Platonov\" for which she earned a Tony nomination as Best Actress in a Play. Also in 2017, she was selected for the highest honor in her birth country: the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).",

Her father was from a Jewish family, while her mother is of mostly German descent. When Gwyneth was eleven, the family moved to Massachusetts, where her father began working in summer stock productions in the Berkshires.

        "bio": "Barry Robert Pepper was born on April 4, 1970, in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada. He has two older brothers named Alex and Doug Pepper. The Peppers didn't stick around Campbell River for too long. They had been building a ship in their backyard for years. When Barry was five years old, the ship was done and the family set sail. The ship, named \"The Moonlighter,\" was a 50-foot craft that would be their home for the next five years. They navigated through the South Pacific islands, using only a sextant and the stars as guides. While visiting such exotic locales as Fiji and Tahiti, Barry was educated through correspondence courses and sometimes enrolled in public schools. He grew up around Polynesian children and credits them for his love of dance, music and other expressive arts. Barry had plenty of time to practice his newfound loves, too. Without television as entertainment on the ship, the family relied on games and sketch acting for fun. When the five-year cruise was over, the Peppers returned to their native Canada, where they set up shop on a small island off the West Coast near Vancouver. They built a farm on the outskirts of a small artists' town, which was populated mainly by hippies, poets, musicians and other craftsmen. While in high school, Barry was enthusiastic about art and excelled in sports. In addition to playing volleyball, he was an excellent rugby player. He graduated in 1988 from George P. Vanier High School in Courtenay and then enrolled in college and majored in marketing and graphic design, but after getting involved with the Vancouver Actors Studio, he changed his course. Once again, he was using \"the stars\" to navigate. Barry landed his first role on Madison (1993) (a sort of Canadian 90210) and other prominent television series before moving on to more prestigious roles in the US. Television movies followed, most notably the mini-series Titanic (1996), which costarred George C. Scott. Still, Barry's career really wasn't taking off. He was a hard-working actor, but not a star. That all changed in 1998. After a string of big screen duds, Pepper obtained his breakthrough role as a Bible-quoting sniper in Steven Spielberg's WW II drama Saving Private Ryan (1998). With the success of the film came sudden stardom for its cast--complete with photo spreads, interviews and even some Oscar buzz. Barry followed the film with a small but noteworthy role in the blockbuster, Enemy of the State (1998) opposite Will Smith and Gene Hackman. Next he co-starred in an Oscar-worthy film starring Tom Hanks: Stephen King's The Green Mile (1999). Barry received much critical acclaim in 2001 for his portrayal of Roger Maris in the made-for-cable drama about the 1961 home run race between Maris and Mickey Mantle called 61* (2001).",

The two Puerto Ricans were brought to the continental United States during their childhoods and eventually met while living in New York City. Their daughters would have a stable, middle-class upbringing.Jennifer always dreamed of being a multi-tasking superstar. As a child, she enjoyed a variety of musical genres, mainly Afro-Caribbean rhythms like salsa, merengue, and bachata, and mainstream music like pop, hip-hop, and R&B. Although she loved music, the film industry also intrigued her. Her biggest influence was the Rita Moreno musical, West Side Story (1961). At 5, Jennifer began taking singing and dancing lessons. Aside from being a budding entertainer, Jennifer was also a Catholic schoolgirl, attending eight years at a Catholic elementary school named Holy Family, located in The Bronx, before graduating from all-girls prep school Preston High School after a four-year stay. At school, Jennifer was an amazing athlete and participated in track and field and tennis. She spent most of her upbringing in a two-story house in the Castle Hill neighborhood.At 18, Jennifer moved out of her parents' home. After high school, she briefly worked in a law office and took dance classes at night. During this time, she continued dance classes at night. Her big break came when she was offered a job as a fly girl on Fox's hit comedy In Living Color (1990). After a two-year stay at In Living Color (1990) where actress Rosie Perez served as choreographer, Lopez then went on to dance for famed singer-actress Janet Jackson. Her first major film was Gregory Nava's My Family/Mi familia (1995), and her career went into overdrive when she portrayed late Tejana singer Selena in Selena (1997).",

His father was of Irish and German ancestry, while his maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Minsk, Belarus. Harrison was a lackluster student at Maine Township High School East in Park Ridge Illinois (no athletic star, never above a C average). After dropping out of Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he did some acting and later summer stock, he signed a Hollywood contract with Columbia and later Universal. His roles in movies and television (Ironside (1967), The Virginian (1962)) remained secondary and, discouraged, he turned to a career in professional carpentry. He came back big four years later, however, as Bob Falfa in American Graffiti (1973). Four years after that, he hit colossal with the role of Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). Another four years and Ford was Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Four years later and he received Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for his role as John Book in Witness (1985). All he managed four years after that was his third starring success as Indiana Jones; in fact, many of his earlier successful roles led to sequels as did his more recent portrayal of Jack Ryan in Patriot Games (1992). Another Golden Globe nomination came his way for the part of Dr. Richard Kimble in The Fugitive (1993). He is clearly a well-established Hollywood superstar. He also maintains an 800-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Ford is a private pilot of both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, and owns an 800-acre (3.2 km2) ranch in Jackson, Wyoming, approximately half of which he has donated as a nature reserve. On several occasions, Ford has personally provided emergency helicopter services at the request of local authorities, in one instance rescuing a hiker overcome by dehydration. Ford began flight training in the 1960s at Wild Rose Idlewild Airport in Wild Rose, Wisconsin, flying in a Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacer, but at $15 an hour, he could not afford to continue the training. In the mid-1990s, he bought a used Gulfstream II and asked one of his pilots, Terry Bender, to give him flying lessons. They started flying a Cessna 182 out of Jackson, Wyoming, later switching to Teterboro, New Jersey, flying a Cessna 206, the aircraft he soloed in. Ford is an honorary board member of the humanitarian aviation organization Wings of Hope.On March 5, 2015, Ford's plane, believed to be a Ryan PT-22 Recruit, made an emergency landing on the Penmar Golf Course in Venice, California. Ford had radioed in to report that the plane had suffered engine failure. He was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he was reported to be in fair to moderate condition.

        "bio": "When hunky, twenty-year-old heart-throb Heath Ledger first came to the attention of the public in 1999, it was all too easy to tag him as a \"pretty boy\" and an actor of little depth. He spent several years trying desperately to sway this image, but this was a double-edged sword. His work comprised nineteen films, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Ned Kelly (2003), The Brothers Grimm (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Casanova (2005), Candy (2006), I'm Not There (2007), The Dark Knight (2008) and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009). He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.Heath Ledger was born on the fourth of April 1979, in Perth, Western Australia, to Sally (Ramshaw), a teacher of French, and Kim Ledger, a mining engineer who also raced cars. His ancestry was Scottish, English, Irish, and Sephardi Jewish. As the story goes, in junior high school it was compulsory to take one of two electives, either cooking or drama. As Heath could not see himself in a cooking class he tried his hand at drama. Heath was talented, however the rest of the class did not acknowledge his talent. When he was seventeen he and a friend decided to pack up, leave school, take a car and rough it to Sydney. Heath believed Sydney to be the place where dreams were made or, at least, where actors could possibly get their big break. Upon arriving in Sydney with a purported sixty-nine cents to his name, Heath tried everything to get a break.His first real acting job came in a low-budget movie called Blackrock (1997), a largely unimpressive cliché; an adolescent angst film about one boy's struggle when he learns his best mate raped a girl. He only had a very small role in the film. After that small role Heath auditioned for a role in a T.V. show called Sweat (1996) about a group of young Olympic hopefuls. He was offered one of two roles, one as a swimmer, another as a gay cyclist. Heath accepted the latter because he felt to really stand out as an actor one had to accept unique roles that stood out from the bunch. It got him small notice, but unfortunately the show was quickly axed, forcing him to look for other roles. He was in Home and Away (1988) for a very short period, in which he played a surfer who falls in love with one of the girls of Summer Bay. Then came his very brief role in Paws (1997), a film which existed solely to cash in on guitar prodigy Nathan Cavaleri's brief moment of fame, where he was the hottest thing in Australia. Heath played a student in the film, involved in a stage production of a Shakespeare play, in which he played \"Oberon\". A very brief role, this offered him a small paycheck but did nothing to advance his career. Then came Two Hands (1999). He went to the U.S. trying to audition for film roles, showcasing his brief role in Roar (1997) opposite then unknown Vera Farmiga.Then Australian director Gregor Jordan auditioned him for the lead in Two Hands (1999), which he got. An in your face Aussie crime thriller, Two Hands (1999) was outstanding and helped him secure a role in 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). After that, it seemed Heath was being typecast as a young hunk, which he did not like, so he accepted a role in a very serious war drama The Patriot (2000).What followed was a stark inconsistency of roles, Ledger accepting virtually every single character role, anything to avoid being typecast. Some met with praise, like his short role in Monster's Ball (2001), but his version of Ned Kelly (2003) was an absolute flop, which led distributors hesitant to even release it outside Australia. Heath finally had deserved success with his role in Brokeback Mountain (2005). For his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in in the film, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and Best International Actor from the Australian Film Institute, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and for the Academy Award for Best Actor.Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008 in his apartment in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo, with a bottle of prescription sleeping pills near-by. It was concluded weeks later that he died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs that included pain-killers, sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication. His death occurred during editing of The Dark Knight (2008) and in the midst of filming his last role as Tony in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009).Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I'm Not There (2007), which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan's life and persona.A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his performance as the Joker in 'The Dark Knight (2008). His untimely death cast a somber shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $185 million Batman production. Ledger received more than thirty posthumous accolades for his critically acclaimed performance as the Joker, the psychopathic clown prince of crime, in the film, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards (for which he is the second actor to win an acting award posthumously after Peter Finch who won an Oscar for Network (Best Actor 1977)), the 2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.",

It was then that Aiko Suzuki (sister of David Suzuki) came to his class and taught a course in super 8 filmmaking. John played his first leading role as a blind boy in a film shot in the then new Spadina subway station. Nevertheless, it would take some time and a diversion into athletics before John would return to his passion for the arts.John would eventually find his focus in athletics at Central Tech High School. John would go on to be part of the record breaking 4x100m relay team alongside Olympian Atlee Mahorn. It was his speed that would catch the attention of the football team and in his senior year he would be awarded an Athletic Scholarship to Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, BC. It was in the Simon Fraser Theater program that John's passion for acting was ignited. John would waste no time, and after 2 years at the University John made the move to New York to join his older brother Frank to further his studies and commit to acting as a life choice. By day John studied with acclaimed acting teacher Julie Bovasso. At night John would go to what he calls \"one of the greatest jobs I have ever talked my way into\" - an usher at the renowned Vivian Beaumont Theater in the beautiful Lincoln Center. Nightly, John would seat his audiences and then get lost in the magic of the theater as he quietly perched at the top of the stairs.John found his way back to Vancouver where he spent a few years doing plays, a variety of TV and film projects and eventually landed his first big Hollywood Feature Film- Alive. Soon after John was in Los Angeles for the Premiere of Alive, and quickly began landing roles, resulting in a permanent move to L.A.While in LA John co-wrote, produced and starred in the award winning independent film Break A Leg starring Molly Parker, Jennifer Beals, Sandra Oh, Kevin Corrigan and Eric Roberts. Break A Leg went on to win over 10 Best Feature or Audience Awards at various US festivals including Best Actor for John at The Marco Island Film Festival.John has dazzled audiences and reviewers alike with his acting range, having one reviewer state, \"It's hard to believe this is the same performer who played the steely-eyed, borderline dangerous nightclub manager in Intelligence. Leslie Nielson and Cassini's scenes together in Robson Arms are the stuff of great comedy.\" (Can West Service - Alex Strachan).In 2018 John was awarded the Vancouver Film Critics Circle Award for Achievement and in 2020 he won the UBCP/ACTRA Award for Best Lead Actor for his performance in Daughter.In the theatre world, John appeared on stage in the spring of 2012 in the play God Of Carnage at the Manitoba Theatre Centre and the Vancouver Playhouse.

During his early\nchildhood, the Weaving family spent most of their time traveling\nbetween Nigeria, Great Britain, and Australia. This was due to the\ncross-country demands of his father's job in the computer industry.\nLater, during his teens, Hugo spent three years in England in the\nseventies attending Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School in Bristol.\nThere, he showed early promise in theater productions and also excelled\nat history, achieving an A in his O-level examination. He arrived\npermanently in Australia in 1976 and finished his education at Knox\nGrammar School, Sydney. He graduated from NIDA (National Institute of\nDramatic Art), a college well-known for other alumni such as\nMel Gibson and\nGeoffrey Rush, in 1981. Since then, Hugo\nhas had a steadily successful career in the film, television, and\ntheater industries. However, he has illustrated that, as renowned as he\nis known for his film work, he feels most at home on stage and\ncontinually performs in Australian theater productions, usually with\nthe Sydney Theater Company. With his success has also come extensive\nrecognition. He has won numerous awards, including two Australian Film\nInstitute Awards (AFI) for Best Actor in a Leading Role and three total\nnominations. The AFI is the Australian equivalent of an Academy Award,\nand Hugo won for his performances in\nProof (1991) and\nThe Interview (1998).

        "bio": "American actor, filmmaker and activist Edward Harrison Norton was born on August 18, 1969, in Boston, Massachusetts, and was raised in Columbia, Maryland.His mother, Lydia Robinson \"Robin\" (Rouse), was a foundation executive and teacher of English, and a daughter of famed real estate developer James Rouse, who developed Columbia, MD; she passed away of brain cancer on March 6, 1997. His father, Edward Mower Norton, was an environmental lawyer and conservationist, who works for the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Edward has two younger siblings, James and Molly.From the age of five onward, the Yale graduate (majoring in history) was interested in acting. At the age of eight, he would ask his drama teacher what his motivation in a scene was. He attended theater schools throughout his life, and eventually managed to find work on stage in New York as a member of the Signature players, who produced the works of playwright and director Edward Albee. Around the time when he was appearing in Albee's Fragments, in Hollywood, they were looking for a young actor to star opposite Richard Gere in a new courtroom thriller, Primal Fear (1996). The role was offered to Leonardo DiCaprio but he turned it down. Gere was on the verge of walking away from the project, fed up with the wait for a young star to be found, when Edward auditioned and won the role over 2000 other hopefuls. Before the film was even released, his test screenings for the part were causing a Hollywood sensation, and he was soon offered roles in Woody Allen's Everyone Says I Love You (1996) and The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996). Edward won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Primal Fear (1996). In 1998, Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle and transformed his look into that of a monstrous skinhead for his role as a violent white supremacist in American History X (1998). This performance earned him his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actor.He received his third Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor, for his work in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014). His most prominent roles also include the critically acclaimed Everyone Says I Love You (1996), The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Fight Club (1999), Red Dragon (2002), 25th Hour (2002), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), The Illusionist (2006), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). He has also directed and co-written films, including his directorial debut, Keeping the Faith (2000). He has done uncredited work on the scripts for The Score (2001), Frida (2002), and The Incredible Hulk (2008).Alongside his work in cinema, Norton is an environmental and social activist, and is a member of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners, a non-profit organization for developing affordable housing founded by his grandfather James Rouse.",

His father, Tony Tarantino, is an Italian-American actor and musician from New York, and his mother, Connie (McHugh), is a nurse from Tennessee. Quentin moved with his mother to Torrance, California, when he was four years old.In January of 1992, first-time writer-director Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) appeared at the Sundance Film Festival. The film garnered critical acclaim and the director became a legend immediately. Two years later, he followed up Dogs success with Pulp Fiction (1994) which premiered at the Cannes film festival, winning the coveted Palme D'Or Award. At the 1995 Academy Awards, it was nominated for the best picture, best director and best original screenplay. Tarantino and writing partner Roger Avary came away with the award only for best original screenplay. In 1995, Tarantino directed one fourth of the anthology Four Rooms (1995) with friends and fellow auteurs Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and Allison Anders. The film opened December 25 in the United States to very weak reviews. Tarantino's next film was From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), a vampire/crime story which he wrote and co-starred with George Clooney. The film did fairly well theatrically.Since then, Tarantino has helmed several critically and financially successful films, including Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004), Inglourious Basterds (2009), Django Unchained (2012) and The Hateful Eight (2015).",

He moved to Los Angeles in 1967 to play in local bands. In 1970, he moved to New York and appeared in the Broadway musicals \"Hair\", \"Rockabye Hamlet\" and \"The Rocky Horror Show,\" and Off Broadway in \"Rainbow\", \"More Than You Deserve\", \"National Lampoon Show\" and the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"As You Like it;\" as well as other productions at the famed New York Public Theatre. He made his film debut with a memorable role in the cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).In 1977, he and lyricist Jim Steinman released an operatic rock album called \"Bat Out Of Hell\"; the record was huge and has sold 50,000,000 copies worldwide and is tied with AC/DC for the 2nd best selling record of all time. The tour and promoting the album took a toll on Meat Loaf's voice and left him unable to sing for 2 years, but with months of rehabilitation, he was able to get back in the studio and record the album \"Dead Ringer\". Meat Loaf stayed in the dark through the 1980s in the US, recording 4 records which got very little airplay or high chart positions in the US but continued to have major chart success in Europe and Australia. The 1981 Single \"Dead Ringer for Love\", a duet with Cher, was a top 10 single in many countries outside the US, but which American radio refused to play.Meat Loaf had many film and TV roles, including the lead character Travis Redfish in Roadie (1980); a pilot in Out of Bounds (1986); in The Squeeze (1987) with Michael Keaton; and Fred in Focus (2001) (based on the Arthur Miller book by the same name), with Laura Dern and William H. Macy. When Meat Loaf and Steinman got back together in 1993, they delivered a powerful sequel, \"Bat Out Of Hell II\", which went to #1 in the US and UK and 26 other countries. Bat II sold over 22,000,000 copies.He appeared in many films, including Crazy in Alabama (1999), Formula 51 (2001) (with Samuel L. Jackson), and Fight Club (1999) (with Brad Pitt). TV credits included guest starring roles as a soldier being held prisoner in Vietnam in Lightning Force (1991), a newspaper reporter in the hit series Glee (2009), a slick landlord of a restaurant who ends up on the menu in HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989) a blacksmith on Showtime's Dead Man's Gun (1997), as fur trader Jake in Masters of Horror (2005) episode Pelts (2006), in House (2004) as caring husband Eddie, and, most recently, in the supporting role of Doug in the SYFY series Ghost Wars (2017). Hugh Laurie (star of \"House\") played piano on the song \"If I Can't Have You\" on Meat Loaf's album \"Hang Cool Teddy Bear\", which was produced by award-winning music producer Rob Cavallo. (Jack Black also sang on the album.)Marvin Lee Aday died on January 20, 2022 in Austin, Texas from COVID-19 complications.",

        "bio": "Richard Conte was born Nicholas Richard Conte on March 24, 1910, in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of an Italian-American barber. He held a variety of jobs before becoming a professional actor, including truck driver, Wall Street clerk and singing waiter at a Connecticut resort. The gig as a singing waiter led to theatrical work in New York, where in 1935, he was discovered by actors Elia Kazan and Julius \"Julie\" Garfinkle (later known as John Garfield).Kazan helped Conte obtain a scholarship to study acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where he excelled. Conte made his Broadway debut late in \"Moon Over Mulberry Street\" in 1939, and went on to be featured in other plays, including \"Walk Into My Parlor.\" His stage work lead to a movie job, and he made his film debut in Heaven with a Barbed Wire Fence (1939), in which he was billed as \"Nicholas Conte.\" His career started to thrive during the Second World War, when many Hollywood actors were away in the military.Signing on as a contract player with 20th Century-Fox in 1942, Conte was promoted by the studio as, ironically, as \"New John Garfield,\" the man who helped discover him. He made his debut at Fox, under the name \"Richard Conte\", in Guadalcanal Diary (1943). During World War II Conte appeared mostly as soldiers in war pictures, although after the war he became a fixture in the studio's \"film noir\" crime melodramas. His best role at Fox was as the wrongly imprisoned man exonerated by James Stewart's reporter in Call Northside 777 (1948) and he also shined as a trucker in Thieves' Highway (1949).In the 1950s Conte essentially evolved into a B-movie actor, his best performances coming in The Blue Gardenia (1953) and Highway Dragnet (1954). After being set free of his Fox contract in the early 1950s, his career lost momentum as the film noir cycle exhausted itself, although he turned in a first-rate performance as a vicious but philosophical gangster in Joseph H. Lewis film-noir classic, The Big Combo (1955).Conte appeared often on television, including a co-starring gig on the syndicated series The Four Just Men (1959), but by the 1960s his career was in turnaround. Frank Sinatra cast him in his two Tony Rome detective films, the eponymous Tony Rome (1967) and Lady in Cement (1968), but Conte eventually relocated to Europe. He directed and starred in Operation Cross Eagles (1968), a low-budget war picture shot in Yugoslavia. His last hurrah in Hollywood role was as Don Corleone's rival, Don Barzini, in The Godfather (1972), which many critics and filmmakers, including the late Stanley Kubrick, consider the greatest Hollywood film of all time. Ironically, Paramount - which produced \"The Godfather\" - had considered Conte for the title role before the casting list was whittled down to Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando. After The Godfather (1972), Conte - whose character was assassinated in that picture, so does not appear in the equally classic sequel - continued to appear in European films.Richard Conte was married to Ruth Storey, with whom he fathered film editor Mark Conte. He died of a heart attack\non April 15, 1975, in Los Angeles, California, aged 65.",

        "bio": "Actor Ralph Nathaniel Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes was born on December 22, 1962 in Suffolk, England, to Jennifer Anne Mary Alleyne (Lash), a novelist, and Mark Fiennes, a photographer. He is the eldest of six children. Four of his siblings are also in the arts: Martha Fiennes, a director; Magnus Fiennes, a musician; Sophie Fiennes, a producer; and Joseph Fiennes, an actor. He is of English, Irish, and Scottish origin.A noted Shakespeare interpreter, he first achieved success onstage at the Royal National Theatre. Fiennes first worked on screen in 1990 and then made his film debut in 1992 as Heathcliff in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights (1992), opposite Juliette Binoche. 1993 was his \"breakout year\". He had a major role in the controversial Peter Greenaway film The Baby of Mâcon (1993), with Julia Ormond, which was poorly received. Later that year he became known internationally for portraying the amoral Nazi concentration camp commandant Amon Goeth in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993). For this he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. He did not win, but did win the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA Award for the role, as well as Best Supporting Actor honors from numerous critics groups, including the National Society of Film Critics, and the New York, Chicago, Boston, and London Film Critics associations. His portrayal as Göth also earned him a spot on the American Film Institute's list of Top 50 Film Villains. To look suitable to represent Goeth, Fiennes gained weight, but he managed to shed it afterwards. In 1994, he portrayed American academic Charles Van Doren in Quiz Show (1994). In 1996, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Count Almásy the World War II epic romance, and another Best Picture winner, Anthony Minghella's The English Patient (1996), in which he starred with Kristin Scott Thomas. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations, as well as\ntwo Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award nominations, one for Best Actor and another shared with the film's ensemble cast.Since then, Fiennes has been in a number of notable films, including Strange Days (1995), Oscar and Lucinda (1997), the animated The Prince of Egypt (1998), István Szabó's Sunshine (1999), Neil Jordan-directed films The End of the Affair (1999) and The Good Thief (2002), Red Dragon (2002), Maid in Manhattan (2002), The Constant Gardener (2005), In Bruges (2008), The Reader (2008), co-starring Kate Winslet, Kathryn Bigelow's Oscar®-winning The Hurt Locker (2008), Clash of the Titans (2010), Mike Newell's screen adaptation of Charles Dickens'Great Expectations (2012), with Helena Bonham Carter and Jeremy Irvine, and Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014).He is also known for his roles in major film franchises such as the Harry Potter film series (2005-2011), in which he played the evil Lord\nVoldemort.

Ralph also appears in the James Bond series, in which he has played M, starting with the 2012 film Skyfall (2012).In 2011, Fiennes made his directorial debut with his film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy political thriller Coriolanus (2011), in which he also played the title character, opposite Gerard Butler and Vanessa Redgrave. Fiennes has won a Tony Award for playing Prince Hamlet on Broadway.In 2015, Fiennes played a music producer in Luca Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash (2015), starring opposite Tilda Swinton and Matthias Schoenaerts, and in 2016, Fiennes starred in Joel and Ethan Coen's Hail, Caesar!

        "bio": "Gaunt character actor Brad Dourif was born Bradford Claude Dourif on March 18, 1950 in Huntington, West Virginia. He is the son of Joan Mavis Felton (Bradford) and Jean Henri Dourif, a French-born art collector who owned and operated a dye factory. His father died when Dourif was three years old, after which his mother married Bill Campbell, a champion golfer, who helped raise Brad, his brother, and his four sisters. From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina, where he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a professional artist, he finally settled on acting as a profession, inspired by his mother's participation as an actress in community theater.Beginning in school productions, he progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players, while attending Marshall University of Huntington. At age 19, he quit his hometown college and headed to New York City, where he worked with the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including Milos Forman who cast him in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Although this film is frequently cited as his film debut, in fact, Dourif made his first big-screen appearance with a bit part in W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings (1975). Nevertheless, his portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in Forman's film was undoubtedly his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award\nfor Best Acting Debut, a British Academy Film Award for Best Supporting Actor, and an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Skeptical of his instant stardom, Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 when he moved to Hollywood. Despite his attempts to avoid typecasting, his intensity destined him to play\neccentric or deranged characters, starting in Eyes of Laura Mars (1978), John Huston's Wise Blood (1979) (arguably his best performance to date), and Milos Forman's Ragtime (1981). Dourif then teamed up with director David Lynch for Dune (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986). His high-strung style also served him well in a number of horror films, notably as the voice of the evil doll Chucky in Child's Play (1988) and its sequels.Dourif broke from the horror genre with roles in Fatal Beauty (1987), Mississippi Burning (1988), Hidden Agenda (1990) and London Kills Me (1991). Recent film work includes the role of Grima Wormtongue in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Since his television debut in the PBS film The Mound Builders (1976), Dourif has made sporadic appearances on a number of television series, such as The X-Files (1993), Babylon 5 (1993), Star Trek: Voyager (1995), Millennium (1996) and Ponderosa (2001). He also appeared in the music video \"Stranger in Town\" (1984) by the rock band TOTO.",

A towering figure at 6' 11\", he carved his niche as a colossus in strength athletics, power-lifting his way to stardom in the mid-90s. His moniker \"Megaman\" aptly captured his gargantuan presence, which saw him dominate strongman contests, including a notable victory in the Highland Games World Strongman Challenge at 26.Born to a lineage of extraordinary individuals, Nathan inherited a legacy of strength and intellect. With roots stretching from the champion caber tosser grandfather in New Zealand to the nautical engineer great grandfather who miraculously survived the icy River Thames, his heritage is a chronicle of triumph over adversity. This lineage of achievers, including an Olympic cyclist grandfather with a penchant for physics and electrical engineering, set the stage for Nathan's own feats of strength and skill.Nathan's transition to WWE in 2002 unveiled \"The Colossus of Boggo Road\" on the SmackDown! roster, a title that evoked his turbulent past and resilience. His stint in professional wrestling was highlighted by appearances with icons like The Undertaker and in marquee events such as WrestleMania XIX.The turn of fate that launched his acting career was as serendipitous as it was spectacular, with martial arts superstar Jackie Chan propelling him onto the silver screen. Nathan's filmography is marked by formidable characters, from the imposing Boagrius in \"TROY\" to the menacing Rictus Erectus in \"Mad Max: Fury Road\". His roles span mythic warriors to modern-day villains, each embodying an intensity that is quintessentially Nathan Jones.Off-screen, Nathan's life is anchored in Queensland, Australia, where he resides with his wife Fawn Tran, his son Justice, and a narrative rich with the spoils of a life lived large. His journey from strongman to screen is not just a story of personal success but a testament to the indomitable human spirit.Written by F. Tran",

        "bio": "Gloria Grahame Hallward, an acting pupil of her mother (stage actress and teacher Jean Grahame), acted professionally while still in high school. In 1944 Louis B. Mayer saw her on Broadway and gave her an MGM contract under the name Gloria Grahame.\nHer debut in the title role of Blonde Fever (1944) was auspicious, but her first public recognition came on loan-out in\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946). Although her talent and sex appeal were of star quality, she did not fit the star pattern at MGM, who sold her contract to RKO in 1947. Here the same problem resurfaced; her best film in these years was made on loan-out, In a Lonely Place (1950). Soon after, she left RKO. The 1950s, her best period, brought her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar and typecast her as shady, inimitably sultry ladies in seven well-known film-noir classics.Rumors of being difficult to work with on the set of Oklahoma! (1955) helped sideline her film career from 1956 onward. She also suffered from marital and child-custody troubles. Eight years after divorce from Nicholas Ray, who was 12 years her senior (and reportedly had discovered her in bed with his 13 year old son), and after a subsequent marriage to Cy Howard ended in divorce, in 1960 she married her former stepson Anthony Ray (who was almost 14 years younger than she was.) This led former husbands Nicholas Ray and Cy Howard to sue Grahame; each man seeking custody of his respective child, putting gossip columnists and scandal sheets into overdrive. Grahame herself underwent electroconvulsive therapy after the ensuing stress caused a nervous breakdown. Surprisingly, however, Grahame and Anthony \"Tony\" Ray proved a happy couple. The union would be Grahame's longest marriage, lasting almost 14 years (10 years longer than her previous union with Ray's father); the couple had two children, Anthony Jr. and James.In 1960, Grahame resumed stage acting, combined with TV work and, from 1970, some mostly inferior films. She was described as a serious, skillful actress; spontaneous, honest, and strong-willed; imaginative and curious; incredibly sexy but insecure about her looks (prompting plastic surgery on her famous lips); loving appreciative male company; \"a bit loony\". In 1975, she was treated for breast cancer. Five years later, she was diagnosed with cancer again, although it is unclear if this was a new cancer or a metastasis of her breast cancer. Grahame eventually moved to England in 1978. Her busiest period of British and American stage work ended abruptly in 1981 when she collapsed from cancer symptoms during a rehearsal. She wished to remain in Liverpool with her partner, Peter Turner (almost 30 years her junior), but after Turner notified her children of her health condition and impending death, two of her children flew to England to retrieve her, insisting she return to the United States. She died a few hours later that same day of stomach cancer and peritonitis at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan on October 5, 1981 at age 57.",

        "bio": "Veteran actor and director Robert Selden Duvall was born on January 5, 1931, in San Diego, CA, to Mildred Virginia (Hart), an amateur actress, and William Howard Duvall, a career military officer who later became an admiral. Duvall majored in drama at Principia College (Elsah, IL), then served a two-year hitch in the army after graduating in 1953. He began attending The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre In New York City on the G.I. Bill in 1955, studying under Sanford Meisner along with Dustin Hoffman, with whom Duvall shared an apartment. Both were close to another struggling young actor named Gene Hackman. Meisner cast Duvall in the play \"The Midnight Caller\" by Horton Foote, a link that would prove critical to his career, as it was Foote who recommended Duvall to play the mentally disabled \"Boo Radley\" in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). This was his first \"major\" role since his 1956 motion picture debut as an MP in Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956), starring Paul Newman.Duvall began making a name for himself as a stage actor in New York, winning an Obie Award in 1965 playing incest-minded longshoreman \"Eddie Carbone\" in the off-Broadway revival of Arthur Miller's \"A View from the Bridge\", a production for which his old roommate Hoffman was assistant director. He found steady work in episodic TV and appeared as a modestly billed character actor in films, such as Arthur Penn's The Chase (1966) with Marlon Brando and in Robert Altman's Countdown (1967) and Francis Ford Coppola's The Rain People (1969), in both of which he co-starred with James Caan.He was also memorable as the heavy who is shot by John Wayne at the climax of True Grit (1969) and was the first \"Maj. Frank Burns\", creating the character in Altman's Korean War comedy M*A*S*H (1970). He also appeared as the eponymous lead in George Lucas' directorial debut, THX 1138 (1971). It was Francis Ford Coppola, casting The Godfather (1972), who reunited Duvall with Brando and Caan and provided him with his career breakthrough as mob lawyer \"Tom Hagen\". He received the first of his six Academy Award nominations for the role.Thereafter, Duvall had steady work in featured roles in such films as The Godfather Part II (1974), The Killer Elite (1975), Network (1976), The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1976) and\nThe Eagle Has Landed (1976). Occasionally this actor's actor got the chance to assay a lead role, most notably in Tomorrow (1972), in which he was brilliant as William Faulkner's inarticulate backwoods farmer. He was less impressive as the lead in Badge 373 (1973), in which he played a character based on real-life NYPD detective Eddie Egan, the same man his old friend Gene Hackman had won an Oscar for playing, in fictionalized form as \"Popeye Doyle\" in The French Connection (1971).It was his appearance as \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in another Coppola picture, Apocalypse Now (1979), that solidified Duvall's reputation as a great actor. He got his second Academy Award nomination for the role, and was named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most versatile actor in the world. Duvall created one of the most memorable characters ever assayed on film, and gave the world the memorable phrase, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\"Subsequently, Duvall proved one of the few established character actors to move from supporting to leading roles, with his Oscar-nominated turns in The Great Santini (1979) and Tender Mercies (1983), the latter of which won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Now at the summit of his career, Duvall seemed to be afflicted with the fabled \"Oscar curse\" that had overwhelmed the careers of fellow Academy Award winners Luise Rainer, Rod Steiger and Cliff Robertson. He could not find work equal to his talents, either due to his post-Oscar salary demands or a lack of perception in the industry that he truly was leading man material. He did not appear in The Godfather Part III (1990), as the studio would not give in to his demands for a salary commensurate with that of Al Pacino, who was receiving $5 million to reprise Michael Corleone.His greatest achievement in his immediate post-Oscar period was his triumphant characterization of grizzled Texas Ranger Gus McCrae in the TV mini-series Lonesome Dove (1989), for which he received an Emmy nomination. He received a second Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in Stalin (1992), and a third Emmy nomination playing Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in The Man Who Captured Eichmann (1996).The shakeout of his career doldrums was that Duvall eventually settled back into his status as one of the premier character actors in the industry, rivaled only by his old friend Gene Hackman. Duvall, unlike Hackman, also has directed pictures, including the documentary We're Not the Jet Set (1974), Angelo My Love (1983) and Assassination Tango (2002). As a writer-director, Duvall gave himself one of his most memorable roles, that of the preacher on the run from the law in The Apostle (1997), a brilliant performance for which he received his third Best Actor nomination and fifth Oscar nomination overall. The film brought Duvall back to the front ranks of great actors, and was followed by a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod for A Civil Action (1998).Robert Duvall will long be remembered as one of the great naturalistic American screen actors in the mode of Spencer Tracy and his frequent co-star Marlon Brando. His performances as \"Boo Radley\" in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), \"Jackson Fentry\" in Tomorrow (1972), \"Tom Hagen\" in the first two \"Godfather\" movies, \"Frank Hackett\" in Network (1976), \"Lt. Col. Kilgore\" in Apocalypse Now (1979), \"Bull Meechum\" in The Great Santini (1979), \"Mac Sledge\" in Tender Mercies (1983), \"Gus McCrae\" in Lonesome Dove (1989) and \"Sonny Dewey\" in The Apostle (1997) rank as some of the finest acting ever put on film. It's a body of work that few actors can equal, let alone surpass.",

        "bio": "Clinton Eastwood Jr. was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, to Clinton Eastwood Sr., a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and Ruth Wood (née Margret Ruth Runner), a housewife turned IBM clerk. He grew up in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. In 1949, the year he is said to have graduated from high school, his parents and younger sister Jeanne moved to Seattle. Clint spent a couple years in the Pacific Northwest himself, operating log broncs in Springfield, Oregon, with summer gigs life-guarding in Renton, Washington. Returning to California in 1951, he did a two-year stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at L.A. City College, but dropped out to pursue acting.During the mid-1950s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Revenge of the Creature (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income. In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with Eric Fleming. Although only a secondary player the first seven seasons, he was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.Eastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with Enrico Maria Salerno providing the voice of Eastwood's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967-68. As the last film racked up respectable grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from a barely registering actor to sought-after commodity in just a matter of months. Again a success was the late-blooming star's first U.S.-made western, Hang 'Em High (1968). He followed that up with the lead role in Coogan's Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Where Eagles Dare (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969). In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and Kelly's Heroes (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.1971 proved to be his busiest year in film. He starred as a sleazy Union soldier in The Beguiled (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971). His role as the hard edge police inspector in Dirty Harry (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre. Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the Dirty Harry sequels Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976), the action-packed road adventures Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), and the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979). He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Every Which Way But Loose (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is. In short, The Eiger Sanction (1975) notwithstanding, the 1970s were nonstop success for Eastwood.Eastwood kicked off the 1980s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose. The fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: \"Make my day.\" He also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Tightrope (1984), City Heat (1984), Pale Rider (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period. In 1988, he did his fifth and final Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had. About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and The Rookie (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before. He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).Eastwood bounced back big time with his dark western Unforgiven (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director. Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received A Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner. Next was a love story, The Bridges of Madison County (1995), where Eastwood surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out. Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while True Crime (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.Eastwood surprised again in the mid-2000s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too. His next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation. 2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Trouble with the Curve (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs. Eastwood & Company (2012).Between acting jobs, he chalked up an impressive list of credits behind the camera. He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Changeling (2008) (a vehicle for Angelina Jolie), Invictus (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter (2010), J. Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and The 15:17 to Paris (2018). Back on screens after a considerable absence, he played an unlikely drug courier in The Mule (2018), which reached the top of the box office with a nine-figure gross, then directed Richard Jewell (2019). At age 91, Eastwood made history as the oldest actor to star above the title in a movie with the release of Cry Macho (2021).Away from the limelight, Eastwood has led an aberrant existence and is described by biographer Patrick McGilligan as a cunning manipulator of the media. His convoluted slew of partners and children are now somewhat factually acknowledged, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The actor refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day. He had a longtime relationship with similarly abstruse co-star Locke (who died aged 74 in 2018, though for her entire public life she masqueraded about being younger), and has fathered at least eight children by at least six different women in an unending string of liaisons, many of which overlapped. He has been married only twice, however, with a mere three of his progeny coming from those unions.His known children are: Laurie Murray (b. 1954), whose mother is unidentified; Kimber Eastwood (b. 1964) with stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis; Kyle Eastwood (b. 1968) and Alison Eastwood (b. 1972) with his first ex-wife, Margaret Neville Johnson; Scott Eastwood (b. 1986) and Kathryn Eastwood (b. 1988) with stewardess Jacelyn Reeves; Francesca Eastwood (b. 1993) with actress Frances Fisher; and Morgan Eastwood (b. 1996) with his second ex-wife, Dina Eastwood. The entire time that he lived with Locke she was legally married to sculptor Gordon Anderson.Eastwood has real estate holdings in Bel-Air, La Quinta, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Cassel (in remote northern California), Idaho's Sun Valley and Kihei, Hawaii.",

Eugenie's uniqueness was instrumental in booking The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga and Fear of Rain alongside Harry Connick Jr. and Madison Iseman. Bondurant received high praise for her role as 'Dani McConnell' with The Artful Critic saying \"Eugenie Bondurant might make the most impression\" and The Guardian stating \"Bondurant's creepy performance is the highlight of the film.\"Tall and angular, with knife-blade cheekbones, Bondurant, a fifth-generation resident of NOLA, was \"discovered\" after a bout with cancer left her looking especially exotic and androgynous. Soon she became a working model in the U.S. and Europe. A modeling trip to Los Angeles led to an acting career that's included a string of bizarre characters in TV and film - including Fight Club (with Ed Norton), and Saturday Night Live (with Madonna and Mike Myers). She tossed around comedian Gene Wilder while playing Alice Cooper's favorite Dominatrix on the TV series Something Wilder. And on HBO's Arliss, she played a transvestite who lured a strait-laced athlete into a night of sin. In the indie feature, Donald and Dot Clock, her character bonded with a house-full of rodents.Eugenie shared screen time with actor/director Pollyanna McIntosh in the horror hit Darlin' which debuted at the 2019 SXSW Film Festival.

She was raised on a farm outside the city. Theron is of Afrikaner (Dutch, with some French Huguenot and German) descent, and Afrikaner military figure Danie Theron was her great-great-uncle.Theron received an education as a ballet dancer and has danced both the \"Swan Lake\" and \"The Nutcracker\". There was not much work for a young actress or dancer in South Africa, so she soon traveled to Europe and the United States, where she got a job at the Joffrey Ballet in New York. She was also able to work as a photo model. However, an injured knee put a halt to her dancing career.In 1994, her mother bought her a one-way ticket to Los Angeles, and Charlize started visiting all of the agents on Hollywood Boulevard, but without any luck. She went to a bank to cash a check for $500 she received from her mother, and became furious when she learned that the bank would not cash it because it was an out-of-state check. She made a scene and an agent gave her his card, in exchange for learning American English, which she did by watching soap operas on television.Her first role was in the B-film Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995), a non-speaking part with three seconds of screen time. Her next role was as Helga Svelgen in 2 Days in the Valley (1996), which landed her the role of Tina Powers in That Thing You Do! (1996). Since then, she has starred in movies like The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), The Cider House Rules (1999), The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000) and The Italian Job (2003). On February 29, 2004, she won her first Academy Award, a Best Actress Oscar for her performance in Monster (2003).",

        "bio": "Diane Keaton was born Diane Hall in Los Angeles, California, to Dorothy Deanne (Keaton), an amateur photographer, and John Newton Ignatius \"Jack\" Hall, a civil engineer and real estate broker. She studied Drama at Santa Ana College, before dropping out in favor of the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. After appearing in summer stock for several months, she got her first major stage role in the Broadway rock musical \"Hair\". As understudy to the lead, she gained attention by not removing any of her clothing. In 1968, Woody Allen cast her in his Broadway play \"Play It Again, Sam,\" which had a successful run. It was during this time that she became involved with Allen and appeared in a number of his films. The first one was Play It Again, Sam (1972), the screen adaptation of the stage play. That same year Francis Ford Coppola cast her as Kay in the Oscar-winning The Godfather (1972), and she was on her way to stardom. She reprized that role in the film's first sequel, The Godfather Part II (1974). She then appeared with Allen again in Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975).In 1977, she broke away from her comedy image to appear in the chilling Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), which won her a Golden Globe nomination. It was the same year that she appeared in what many regard as her best performance, in the title role of Annie Hall (1977), which Allen wrote specifically for her (her real last name is Hall, and her nickname is Annie), and what an impact she made. She won the Oscar and the British Award for Best Actress, and Allen won the Directors Award from the DGA. She started a fashion trend with her unisex clothes and was the poster girl for a lot of young males. Her mannerisms and awkward speech became almost a national craze. The question being asked, though, was, \"Is she just a lightweight playing herself, or is there more depth to her personality?\" For whatever reason, she appeared in but one film a year for the next two years and those films were by Allen. When they broke up she was next involved with Warren Beatty and appeared in his film Reds (1981), as the bohemian female journalist Louise Bryant. For her performance, she received nominations for the Academy Award and the Golden Globe. For the rest of the 1980s she appeared infrequently in films but won nominations in three of them. Attempting to break the typecasting she had fallen into, she took on the role of a confused, somewhat naive woman who becomes involved with Middle Eastern terrorists in The Little Drummer Girl (1984). To offset her lack of movie work, Diane began directing. She directed the documentary Heaven (1987), as well as some music videos. For television she directed an episode of the popular, but strange, Twin Peaks (1990).In the 1990s, she began to get more mature roles, though she reprized the role of Kay Corleone in the third \"Godfather\" epic, The Godfather Part III (1990). She appeared as the wife of Steve Martin in the hit Father of the Bride (1991) and again in Father of the Bride Part II (1995). In 1993 she once again teamed with Woody Allen in Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993), which was well received. In 1995 she received high marks for Unstrung Heroes (1995), her first major feature as a director.",

He was raised by his astrologer/psychologist mother, Delora Sherleen (Sinclair), and adoptive father, Irving H. Vincent, an acting instructor and theatre manager, in an artists' housing project in New York City's Greenwich Village. He never knew his biological father. His mother is white (with English, German, Scottish, and Irish ancestry), and his adoptive father is African-American; referring to his biological father's background, Diesel has said that he himself is \"definitely a person of colour\".His first break in acting happened by chance, when at the age of seven he and his friends broke into a theatre to vandalize it. A woman stopped them and offered them each a script and $20, on the condition that they would attend everyday after school. From there, Vin's fledgling career progressed from the New York repertory company run by his father, to the Off-Off-Broadway circuit. At age seventeen and already sporting a well-honed physique, he became a bouncer at some of New York's hippest clubs to earn himself some extra cash. It was at this time that he changed his name to Vin Diesel.Following high school, Vin enrolled as an English major at Hunter College, but dropped out after three years to go to Hollywood to further his acting career. Being an experienced theatre actor did not make any impression in Hollywood and after a year of struggling to make his mark, he returned to New York. His mother then gave him a book called \"Feature Films at used Car Prices\" by Rick Schmidt. The book showed him that he could take control of his career and make his own movies. He wrote a short film based on his own experiences as an actor, called Multi-Facial (1995), which was shot in less than three days at a cost of $3,000. Multi-Facial (1995) was eventually accepted for the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it got a tumultuous reception.Afterwards, Vin returned to Los Angeles and raised almost $50,000 through telemarketing to fund the making of his first feature, Strays (1997). Six months after shooting, the film was accepted for the 1997 Sundance Film Festival, and although it received a good reception, it did not sell as well as hoped. Yet again Vin returned disappointed to New York only to receive a dream phone call. Steven Spielberg was impressed by Multi-Facial (1995) and wanted to meet Vin, leading him to be cast in Saving Private Ryan (1998). Multi-Facial (1995) earned Vin more work, when the director of The Iron Giant (1999) saw it and decided to cast Vin in the title role. From there, Vin's career steadily grew, with him securing his first lead role, as Richard B. Riddick in the sci-fi film Pitch Black (2000). The role has earned him a legion of devoted fans and the public recognition he deserves.Since then, he has headlined a series of blockbusters, often but not only centered on fast-driving motor vehicles: The Fast and the Furious (2001), xXx (2002), The Pacifier (2005), Fast & Furious (2009), Fast Five (2011), Fast & Furious 6 (2013), and Furious 7 (2015). He also voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and starred in the lower-budgeted courtroom drama Find Me Guilty (2006), the latter directed by Sidney Lumet.",

But before he became a famous actor, he intended to pursue a career in law.Strong was born Marco Giuseppe Salussolia in London, England, to an Austrian mother and an Italian father. His father left the family not long after he was born, and his mother worked as an au pair to raise the boy on her own. Strong's mother had his name legally changed, by deed poll, when he was young in order to help him better assimilate with his peers. He became Mark Strong.Strong attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, and studied at the university level in Munich with the intent of becoming a lawyer. After a year, he returned to London to study English and Drama at Royal Holloway. He went on to further master his craft of at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.Although Americans are most familiar with Strong's roles as Sinestro in Green Lantern (2011), mob boss Frank D'Amico in Kick-Ass (2010), and Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes (2009), British audiences know him from his long history as a television actor. He also starred in as numerous British stage productions, including plays at the Royal National Theatre and the RSC.His most prominent television parts include Prime Suspect 3 (1993) and Prime Suspect: The Last Witness (2003) as Inspector Larry Hall, and starring roles in the BBC Two dramas Our Friends in the North (1996) and The Long Firm (2004), the latter of which netted Strong a BAFTA nomination. He also played Mr. Knightley in the 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen's classic tale Emma (1996).Strong resides in London with his wife Liza Marshall, with whom he has two sons, the younger of which is the godson of his longtime friend Daniel Craig.",

        "bio": "After training as a painter (he storyboards his films as full-scale paintings), Kurosawa entered the film industry in 1936 as an assistant director, eventually making his directorial debut with Sanshiro Sugata (1943). Within a few years, Kurosawa had achieved sufficient stature to allow him greater creative freedom. Drunken Angel (1948) was the first film he made without extensive studio interference, and marked his first collaboration with Toshirô Mifune. In the coming decades, the two would make 16 movies together, and Mifune became as closely associated with Kurosawa's films as was John Wayne with the films of Kurosawa's idol, John Ford. After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made his international breakthrough film Rashomon (1950) in 1950. It won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West. The next few years saw the low-key, touching Ikiru (1952) (Living), the epic Seven Samurai (1954), the barbaric, riveting Shakespeare adaptation Throne of Blood (1957), and a fun pair of samurai comedies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962). After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide. He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) and, with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha: The Shadow Warrior (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear.\" He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Dreams (1990), Rhapsody in August (1991) and Madadayo (1993). Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where critics have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors (William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Maxim Gorky and Evan Hunter) with suspicion - but he's revered by American and European film-makers, who remade Rashomon (1950) as The Outrage (1964), Seven Samurai (1954), as The Magnificent Seven (1960), Yojimbo (1961), as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Hidden Fortress (1958),\nas Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977).",

        "bio": "One of Hollywood's finest character / \"Method\" actors, Eli Wallach was in demand for over 60 years (first film/TV role was 1949) on stage\nand screen, and has worked alongside the world's biggest stars, including\nClark Gable,\nClint Eastwood,\nSteve McQueen,\nMarilyn Monroe,\nYul Brynner,\nPeter O'Toole, and\nAl Pacino, to name but a few.Wallach was born on 7 December 1915 in Brooklyn, NY, to Jewish parents\nwho emigrated from Poland, and was one of the few Jewish kids in his\nmostly Italian neighborhood. His parents, Bertha (Schorr) and Abraham\nWallach, owned a candy store, Bertha's Candy Store. He went on to\ngraduate with a B.A. from the University of Texas in Austin, but gained\nhis dramatic training with the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood\nPlayhouse. He made his debut on Broadway in 1945, and won a Tony Award\nin 1951 for portraying Alvaro Mangiacavallo in the\nTennessee Williams play \"The Rose\nTattoo\".Wallach made a strong screen debut in 1956 in the film version of the\nTennessee Williams play\nBaby Doll (1956), shined as \"Dancer\",\nthe nattily dressed hitman, in director\nDon Siegel's film-noir classic\nThe Lineup (1958), and co-starred in\nthe heist film\nSeven Thieves (1960). Director\nJohn Sturges then cast Wallach as vicious\nMexican bandit Calvera in\nThe Magnificent Seven (1960),\nthe western adaptation of the\nAkira Kurosawa epic\nSeven Samurai (1954).\nThe Misfits (1961), in the\nstar-spangled western opus\nHow the West Was Won (1962),\nthe underrated WW2 film\nThe Victors (1963), as a kidnapper in\nThe Moon-Spinners (1964), in\nthe sea epic Lord Jim (1965) and in the\nromantic comedy\nHow to Steal a Million (1966).Looking for a third lead actor in the final episode of the \"Dollars\nTrilogy\", Italian director\nSergio Leone cast the versatile\nWallach as the lying, two-faced, money-hungry (but somehow lovable)\nbandit \"Tuco\" in the spectacular\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n(aka \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\"), arguably his most memorable\nperformance. Wallach kept busy throughout the remainder of the '60s and\ninto the '70s with good roles in\nMackenna's Gold (1969),\nCinderella Liberty (1973),\nCrazy Joe (1974),\nThe Deep (1977) and as\nSteve McQueen's bail buddy in\nThe Hunter (1980).The 1980s was an interesting period for Wallach, as he was regularly\ncast as an aging doctor, a Mafia figure or an over-the-hill hitman,\nsuch as in\nThe Executioner's Song (1982),\nOur Family Honor (1985),\nTough Guys (1986),\nNuts (1987),\nThe Two Jakes (1990) and as the\ncandy-addicted \"Don Altabello\" in\nThe Godfather Part III (1990).\nAt 75+ years of age, Wallach's quality of work was still first class\nand into the 1990s and beyond, he has remained in demand. He lent fine\nsupport to\nVendetta: Secrets of a Mafia Bride (1990),\nTeamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story (1992),\nNaked City: Justice with a Bullet (1998)\nand Keeping the Faith (2000).\nMost recently Wallach showed up as a fast-talking liquor store owner in\nMystic River (2003) and in the\ncomedic drama\nKing of the Corner (2004).In early 2005, Eli Wallach released his much anticipated autobiography,\n\"The Good, The Bad And Me: In My Anecdotage\", an enjoyable reading from\none of the screen's most inventive and enduring actors.Eli Wallach was very much a family man who remained married to his wife\nAnne Jackson for 66 years. When Wallach died at 98, in 2014, in Manhattan, NY, he was survived by\nhis wife, three children, five grandchildren and several\ngreat-grandchildren.",

        "bio": "Since his screen debut as a young Amish farmer in Peter Weir's Witness (1985), Viggo Mortensen's career has been marked by a steady string of well-rounded performances.Mortensen was born in New York City, to Grace Gamble (Atkinson) and Viggo Peter Mortensen, Sr. His father was Danish, his mother was American, and his maternal grandfather was Canadian. His parents met in Norway. They wed and moved to New York, where Viggo, Jr. was born, before moving to South America, where Viggo, Sr. managed chicken farms and ranches in Venezuela and Argentina. Two more sons were born, Charles and Walter, before the marriage grew increasingly unhappy. When Viggo was seven, his parents sent him to the St. Paul's boarding school, in the Córdoba Sierras, in Argentina. Then, at age eleven, his parents divorced. His mother moved herself and the children back to her home state of New York.Viggo attended Watertown High School, and became a very good student and athlete. He graduated in 1976 and went on to St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. After graduation, he moved to Denmark - driven by the need for a defining purpose in life. He began writing poetry and short stories while working many odd jobs, from dock worker to flower seller. In 1982, he fell in love and followed his girlfriend back to New York City, hoping for a long romance and a writing career. He got neither. In New York, Viggo found work waiting tables and tending bar and began taking acting classes, studying with Warren Robertson. He appeared in several plays and movies, and eventually moved to Los Angeles, where his performance in \"Bent\" at the Coast Playhouse earned him a Drama-logue Critic's Award.He made his film debut with a small part in Witness (1985). He appeared in Salvation! (1987) and married his co-star, Exene Cervenka. The two had a son, Henry Mortensen. But after nearly eleven years of marriage, the couple divorced.In 1999, Viggo got a phone call about a movie he did not know anything about: \"The Lord of the Rings.\" At first, he didn't want to do it, because it would mean time away from his son. But Henry, a big fan of the books, told his father he shouldn't turn down the role. Viggo accepted the part and immediately began work on the project, which was already underway. Eventually, the success of \"The Lord of the Rings\" made him a household name - a difficult consequence for the ever private and introspective Viggo.Critics have continually recognized his work in over thirty movies, including such diverse projects as Jane Campion's The Portrait of a Lady (1996), Sean Penn's The Indian Runner (1991), Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way (1993), Ridley Scott's G.I. Jane (1997), Tony Scott's Crimson Tide (1995), Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998), Ray Loriga's My Brother's Gun (1997), Tony Goldwyn's A Walk on the Moon (1999), and Peter Farrelly's Green Book (2018).Mortensen is also an accomplished poet, photographer and painter.",

As a child, David was disadvantaged and a poor student, he found a passion for bodybuilding and weight training in his early teens, as a young adult, David often entered weightlifting competitions and contested in the famous Mr. Universe contest. Eventually, David won the British heavyweight weightlifting title and gained status as a highly regarded and respected member of the fitness community. Over this period of competitive weightlifting, David became lifelong friends with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, who at the time were not professional actors but rival competitors. After appearing on various broadcast sporting events, David was offered a role in the feature film Casino Royale (1967) as \"Frankenstein's Monster\". Although the casting was based on David's stature, David developed a strong interest in acting and decided to pursue it further.From 1967 to 1977, David enjoyed a quiet, but very successful career within film and television starring in such films as A Clockwork Orange (1971), Up Pompeii (1971) and numerous Hammer House of Horror films, gaining a vast and bulky CV. In 1975, David's popularity as a respected fitness guru landed him with the role and duty of the Green Cross Code Man, a superhero designed by the British road safety committee to teach road safety to children. The persona saw David traveling the world to give talks, demonstrations and shoot short television spots based on the hero's message. Proving successful the Green Cross Code Man continued to be a side project throughout David's busy career until the 1990s. He considers this role to be of great importance, and has stated many times that it is possibly the most rewarding job he has held.It was not until 1977 when David attended an audition for a film entitled Star Wars. The film was not considered to be a big thing at the time and the audition was held by director George Lucas. At the meeting, George offered David either the part of Chewbacca or Darth Vader. Instantly turning away the role of Chewbacca, David insisted he play the lead villain Darth Vader. George asked David why he wanted to play Vader and he replied \"Everyone remembers the villain, George.\" David also had a wealth of experience playing villains in previous films, and was the obvious choice. David played the role of Darth Vader for the entirety of the original Star Wars trilogy: Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). Although David does not voice the character, he is the physical body. Star Wars was perhaps David's most important role and a role that has enlisted him as one of the most memorable character villains of all time.There have been many rumors, disputes and discussions about David's relationship with Star Wars and its staff. Regarding the apparent misled information David received about Vader's voice, promotional neglect and general mistreatment from Lucasfilm. This feud resulted in David being banned from all official Star Wars events. A statement from George Lucas read \"He has burnt too many bridges.\" David stated that a majority of the rumors in circulation regarding the topic are fabricated and false including those of respectable actors involved, and has openly admitted his support of James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader and claims Lucas film were too concerned with keeping Vader a character than letting David receive deserved credit. The topic is covered in detail, in David's autobiography \"Straight from the Force's Mouth\". After Star Wars, David continued to work in television and film, making numerous appearances with the legendary Benny Hill. He continued to tour as the Green Cross Code Man and became the personal fitness trainer of many celebrities including Daniel Day-Lewis and Vanessa Redgrave.David was loyal to Star Wars fans and participated in a number of fan-films as various characters spoofing Star Wars. Towards the end of David's busy acting period, his health declined due to a serious inflammation of arthritis, leaving him unable to stand for long periods of time and inflicting agonizing pain on his knees and hips. Undergoing treatment with hip replacement operations, it was discovered that David had prostate cancer in 2009. After a series of radiotherapy treatments at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, David made a full recovery in a remarkably short period of time. David was awarded Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2000 Queen's Millennium Honours List for his contributions to charity and spokesmanship for road safety, the disabled and other various charities. From 2004, David began writing his autobiography entitled \"Straight from the Force's Mouth,\" which covers his career in showbiz and documents an unedited diary account of the Star Wars production. The book was published officially in hardback by Apex Publishing in 2011, and David toured Europe to attend book signings and personal appearances.Over the course of his career, between acting and touring the world both as the Green Cross Code Man and David Prowse, David trained actors for films including Christopher Reeve for Superman (1978), wrote fitness books \"Fitness is Fun\", supported charity and even became the head of fitness for superstore Harrods. In the 2000s, David spent his time attending unofficial Star Wars events, conventions and film events where he signed photos, spoke to the fans and was in high demand as a public speaker all over the world.",

        "bio": "Sergio Leone was virtually born into the cinema - he was the son of Roberto Roberti (A.K.A. Vincenzo Leone), one of Italy's cinema pioneers, and actress Bice Valerian. Leone entered films in his late teens, working as an assistant director to both Italian directors and U.S. directors working in Italy (usually making Biblical and Roman epics, much in vogue at the time). Towards the end of the 1950s he started writing screenplays, and began directing after taking over The Last Days of Pompeii (1959) in mid-shoot after its original director fell ill. His first solo feature, The Colossus of Rhodes (1961), was a routine Roman epic, but his second feature, A Fistful of Dollars (1964),\na shameless remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961), caused a revolution. It was the first Spaghetti Western, and shot T.V. cowboy Clint Eastwood to stardom (Leone wanted Henry Fonda or Charles Bronson but couldn't afford them). The two sequels, For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), were shot on much higher budgets and were even more successful, though his masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), in which Leone finally worked with Fonda and Bronson, was mutilated by Paramount Pictures and flopped at the U.S. box office. He directed Duck, You Sucker! (1971) reluctantly (as producer he hired Peter Bogdanovich to direct but he left before shooting began), and turned down offers to direct The Godfather (1972) in favor of his dream project, which became Once Upon a Time in America (1984). He died in 1989 after preparing an even more expensive Soviet co-production on the World War II siege of Leningrad.",

His mother, Rosalie (Russell), was a Scottish emigrant, from Glasgow. His father, Paul Wälken, was a German emigrant, from Horst, who ran Walken's bakery. Christopher learned his stage craft, including dancing, at Hofstra University & ANTA, and picked up a Theatre World award for his performance in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". Walken then first broke through into cinema in 1969 appearing in Me and My Brother (1968), before appearing alongside Sean Connery in the sleeper heist movie The Anderson Tapes (1971). His eclectic work really came to the attention of critics in 1977 with his intense portrayal of Diane Keaton suicidal younger brother in Annie Hall (1977), and then he scooped the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award in 1977 for his role as Nick in the electrifying The Deer Hunter (1978). Walken was lured back by The Deer Hunter (1978) director Michael Cimino for a role in the financially disastrous western Heaven's Gate (1980), before moving onto surprise audiences with his wonderful dance skills in Pennies from Heaven (1981), taking the lead as a school teacher with telepathic abilities in the Stephen King inspired The Dead Zone (1983) and then as billionaire industrialist Max Zorin trying to blow up Silicon Valley in the 007 adventure A View to a Kill (1985). Looking at many of Walken's other captivating screen roles, it is easy to see the diversity of his range and even his droll comedic talents with humorous appearances in Biloxi Blues (1988), Wayne's World 2 (1993), Joe Dirt (2001), Mousehunt (1997) and America's Sweethearts (2001). Most recently, he continued to surprise audiences again with his work as a heart broken and apologetic father to Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002).",

Growing up the youngest of four siblings in a Catholic family in Warrington, Lancashire (near Liverpool) in middle-class surroundings to working-class parents, he attended St Mary's University (London). However, while completing his studies, he developed an interest in theatre, to the chagrin of his father, who wanted his children to find secure positions in life.A drama teacher initially at a Catholic girls convent school, he decided to follow his acting instincts full-time and gradually built up an impressive array of classical stage credits via repertory, including the Bristol Old Vic Drama School, and in stints with Liverpool Everyman, Manchester Royal Exchange and the Royal Shakespeare Company. By the 1980s he was ready to branch out into film and TV, giving a startling performance as a wife abuser in the Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988).By 1993 he had crossed over into Hollywood parts and earned his first Oscar nomination for his superb role as Daniel Day-Lewis' father in In the Name of the Father (1993). Other quality roles came his way with The Usual Suspects (1995), Brassed Off (1996), and Amistad (1997). He did fine work on television in Sharpe's Company (1994), Lost for Words (1999), and The Sins (2000). Postlethwaite worked equally both in the UK and abroad, and avoided the public limelight for the most part, except for occasional displays of political activism.Postlethwaite lived quietly out of the spotlight in England and continued on in films with roles in The Shipping News (2001), The Limit (2004), Dark Water (2005), The Omen (2006), Ghost Son (2007) and Solomon Kane (2009). In 2010, he was seen in Clash of the Titans (2010), Inception (2010) and The Town (2010).Postlewaite died on January 2, 2011, at age 64, of pancreatic cancer.

        "bio": "Sidney Lumet was a master of cinema, best known for his technical\nknowledge and his skill at getting first-rate performances from his\nactors -- and for shooting most of his films in his beloved New York.\nHe made over 40 movies, often complex and emotional, but seldom overly\nsentimental. Although his politics were somewhat left-leaning and he\noften treated socially relevant themes in his films, Lumet didn't want\nto make political movies in the first place. Born on June 25, 1924, in\nPhiladelphia, the son of actor Baruch Lumet\nand dancer Eugenia Wermus Lumet, he made his stage debut at age four at\nthe Yiddish Art Theater in New York. He played many roles on Broadway\nin the 1930s and also in the film\n...One Third of a Nation... (1939).\nAfter starting an off-Broadway acting troupe in the late 1940s, he\nbecame the director of many television shows in the 1950s. Lumet made\nhis feature film directing debut with\n12 Angry Men (1957), which won the\nGolden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and earned three Academy Award\nnominations. The courtroom drama, which takes place almost entirely in\na jury room, is justly regarded as one of the most auspicious\ndirectorial debuts in film history. Lumet got the chance to direct\nMarlon Brando in\nThe Fugitive Kind (1960), an\nimperfect, but powerful adaptation of\nTennessee Williams' \"Orpheus\nDescending\". The first half of the 1960s was one of Lumet's most\nartistically successful periods.\nLong Day's Journey Into Night (1962),\na masterful, brilliantly photographed adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill\nplay, is one of several Lumet films about families. It earned\nKatharine Hepburn,\nRalph Richardson,\nDean Stockwell and\nJason Robards deserved acting awards in\nCannes and Hepburn an Oscar nomination. The alarming Cold War thriller\nFail Safe (1964) unfairly suffered from\ncomparison to Stanley Kubrick's\nequally great satire\nDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964),\nwhich was released shortly before.\nThe Pawnbroker (1964), arguably\nthe most outstanding of the great movies Lumet made in this phase,\ntells the story of a Holocaust survivor who lives in New York and can't\novercome his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps.\nRod Steiger's unforgettable performance in\nthe title role earned an Academy Award nomination. Lumet's intense\ncharacter study The Hill (1965) about\ninhumanity in a military prison camp was the first of five films he did\nwith Sean Connery. After the overly talky\nbut rewarding drama The Group (1966)\nabout young upper-class women in the 1930s, and the stylish spy\nthriller\nThe Deadly Affair (1967), the\nlate 1960s turned out to be a lesser phase in Lumet's career. He had a\nstrong comeback with the box-office hit\nThe Anderson Tapes (1971).\nThe Offence (1973) was commercially\nless successful, but artistically brilliant - with Connery in one of\nhis most impressive performances. The terrific cop thriller\nSerpico (1973), the first of his films\nabout police corruption in New York City, became one of his biggest\ncritical and financial successes. Al Pacino's\nfascinating portrayal of the real-life cop Frank Serpico earned a\nGolden Globe and the movie earned two Academy Award nominations (it is\nworth noting that Lumet's feature films of the 1970s alone earned 30\nOscar nominations, winning six times). The love triangle\nLovin' Molly (1974) was not always\nconvincing in its atmospheric details, but Lumet's fine sense of\nemotional truth and a good Blythe Danner\nkeep it interesting. The adaptation of\nAgatha Christie's\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974),\nan exquisitely photographed murder mystery with an all-star cast, was a\nbig success again. Lumet's complex crime thriller\nDog Day Afternoon (1975), which\nPauline Kael called \"one of the best \"New\nYork\" movies ever made\", gave Al Pacino the\nopportunity for a breathtaking, three-dimensional portrayal of a\nbisexual man who tries to rob a bank to finance his lover's sex-change\noperation. Lumet's next masterpiece,\nNetwork (1976), was a prophetic satire on\nmedia and society. The film version of\nPeter Shaffer's stage play\nEquus (1977) about a doctor and his\nmentally confused patient was also powerful, not least because of the\nenergetic acting by\nRichard Burton and\nPeter Firth. After the enjoyable\nmusical The Wiz (1978) and the\ninteresting but not easily accessible comedy\nJust Tell Me What You Want (1980),\nSidney Lumet won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for his\noutstanding direction of\nPrince of the City (1981), one\nof his best and most typical films. It's about police corruption, but\nhardly a remake of Serpico (1973).\nStarring a powerful Treat Williams, it's\nan extraordinarily multi-layered film. In his highly informative book\n\"Making Movies\" (1995), Lumet describes the film in the following way:\n\"When we try to control everything, everything winds up controlling us.\nNothing is what it seems.\" It's also a movie about values, friendship\nand drug addiction and, like \"Serpico\", is based on a true story. In\nDeathtrap (1982), Lumet successfully\nblended suspense and black humor.\nThe Verdict (1982) was voted the\nfourth greatest courtroom drama of all time by the American Film\nInstitute in 2008. A few minor inaccuracies in legal details do not mar\nthis study of an alcoholic lawyer (superbly embodied by\nPaul Newman) aiming to regain his\nself-respect through a malpractice case. The expertly directed movie\nreceived five Academy Award nominations. Lumet's controversial drama\nDaniel (1983) with\nTimothy Hutton, an adaptation of\nE.L. Doctorow's \"The Book of Daniel\" about\ntwo young people whose parents were executed during the McCarthy Red\nScare hysteria in the 1950s for alleged espionage, is one of his\nunderrated achievements. His later masterpiece\nRunning on Empty (1988) has a\nsimilar theme, portraying a family which has been on the run from the\nFBI since the parents (played by\nChristine Lahti and\nJudd Hirsch) committed a bomb attack on a\nnapalm laboratory in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam. The son\n(played by River Phoenix in an\nextraordinarily moving, Oscar-nominated performance) falls in love with\na girl and wishes to stay with her and study music.\nNaomi Foner's screenplay won the Golden\nGlobe. Other Lumet movies of the 1980s are the melancholic comedy drama\nGarbo Talks (1984); the occasionally\nclichéd Power (1986) about election\ncampaigns; the all too slow thriller\nThe Morning After (1986) and\nthe amusing gangster comedy\nFamily Business (1989). With\nQ&A (1990) Lumet returned to the genre of\nthe New York cop thriller. Nick Nolte shines\nin the role of a corrupt and racist detective in this multi-layered,\nstrangely underrated film. Sadly, with the exception of\nNight Falls on Manhattan (1996),\nan imperfect but fascinating crime drama in the tradition of his own\nprevious genre works, almost none of Lumet's works of the 1990s did\nquite get the attention they deserved. The crime drama\nA Stranger Among Us (1992)\nblended genres in a way that did not seem to match most viewers'\nexpectations, but its contemplations about life arouse interest. The\nintelligent hospital satire\nCritical Care (1997) was unfairly\nneglected as well. The courtroom thriller\nGuilty as Sin (1993) was cold but\nintriguing. Lumet's Gloria (1999) remake\nseemed unnecessary, but he returned impressively with the\nunderestimated courtroom comedy\nFind Me Guilty (2006) and the\njustly acclaimed crime thriller\nBefore the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007).\nIn 2005, Sidney Lumet received a well-deserved honorary Academy Award\nfor his outstanding contribution to filmmaking. Sidney Lumet tragically\ndied of cancer in 2011.",

        "bio": "Charismatic character star Edward James Begley was born in Hartford, Connecticut of Irish parents and educated at St.Patrick's school. His interest in acting first surfaced at the age of nine, when he performed amateur theatricals at the Hartford Globe Theatre. Determined to make his own way, he left home aged eleven and drifted from job to job, had a four-year stint in the U.S. Navy, then worked in a bowling alley replacing pins, joined carnivals and circuses. In 1931, he appeared in vaudeville and was also hired as a radio announcer, his voice broadcast to nationwide audiences. It took him several years to establish himself on the legitimate stage, but in 1943, he had a role in the short-running play 'Land of Fame'.His first success was the 1947 Arthur Miller play 'All My Sons' and this was followed by the 1925 Scopes Trial fictionalization 'Inherit the Wind' (1955-57), which ran for 806 performances at the National Theatre. Ed, co-starring with Paul Muni,\nplayed the part of Matthew Harrison Brady (played in the 1960 motion picture by Fredric March) and won the 1956\nTony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. Upon Paul Muni's departure from the cast, Ed used the opportunity to play the part of\nHenry Drummond (Spencer Tracy's role in the film) with equal vigor. In 1960, he starred as Senator Orrin Knox in the political drama 'Advise and Consent'. Ed's movie career began with Boomerang! (1947), a murder mystery set in his native Connecticut, directed by Elia Kazan. Heavy-set with bushy eyebrows, the archetypal image of Ed Begley on screen is as a gruff, blustery, often heavily sweating (and sometimes corrupt) politician or industrialist. He proved his mettle in a number of classic films, including\nSorry, Wrong Number (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1951). Whether as the sympathetic executive in Patterns (1956), a bigoted ex-cop turned\nbank robber in Odds Against Tomorrow (1959), or the crazed billionaire bent on world domination of Billion Dollar Brain (1967), he tackled every part that came his way with conviction. The culmination of his work was a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his role of Boss Finley in\nTennessee Williams's Sweet Bird of Youth (1962).In addition to countless radio broadcasts, Ed was also busy in television in the 1950s and '60s. Among frequent guest-starring\nappearances, his dynamic characterizations in two episodes of The Invaders (1967) ('The Betrayed' and 'Labyrinth') in particular stand out. Ed Begley died of a heart attack in April 1970 in Hollywood at the age of 69.",

        "bio": "One of the most influential personalities in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg is Hollywood's best known\ndirector and one of the wealthiest filmmakers in the world. He has an extraordinary number of commercially successful and critically acclaimed credits to his name, either as a director, producer or writer since launching the summer blockbuster with Jaws (1975), and he has done more to define popular film-making since the mid-1970s than anyone else.Steven Allan Spielberg was born in 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Leah Frances (Posner), a concert pianist and restaurateur, and Arnold Spielberg, an electrical engineer who worked in computer development. His parents were both born to Russian Jewish immigrant families. Steven spent his younger years in Haddon Township, New Jersey, Phoenix, Arizona, and later Saratoga, California. He went to California State University Long Beach, but dropped\nout to pursue his entertainment career.\nAmong his\nearly directing efforts were Battle Squad (1961), which combined World\nWar II footage with footage of an airplane on the ground that he makes\nyou believe is moving. He also directed\nEscape to Nowhere (1961), which\nfeatured children as World War Two soldiers, including his sister\nAnne Spielberg, and\nThe Last Gun (1959), a western.\nAll of these were short films. The next couple of years, Spielberg\ndirected a couple of movies that would portend his future career in\nmovies. In 1964, he directed\nFirelight (1964), a movie about aliens\ninvading a small town. In 1967, he directed\nSlipstream (1967), which was\nunfinished. However, in 1968, he directed\nAmblin' (1968), which featured the desert\nprominently, and not the first of his movies in which the desert would\nfeature. Amblin' also became the name of his production\ncompany, which turned out such classics as\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).\nSpielberg had a unique and classic early directing project,\nDuel (1971), with\nDennis Weaver. In the early 1970s,\nSpielberg was working on TV, directing among others such series as\nRod Serling's\nNight Gallery (1969),\nMarcus Welby, M.D. (1969)\nand\nMurder by the Book (1971).\nAll of his work in television and short films, as well as his directing\nprojects, were just a hint of the wellspring of talent that would\ndazzle audiences all over the world.Spielberg's first major directorial effort was\nThe Sugarland Express (1974),\nwith Goldie Hawn, a film that marked him as\na rising star. It was his next effort, however, that made him an\ninternational superstar among directors:\nJaws (1975). This classic shark attack tale\nstarted the tradition of the summer blockbuster or, at least, he was\ncredited with starting the tradition. His next film was the classic\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind (1977),\na unique and original UFO story that remains a classic. In 1978,\nSpielberg produced his first film, the forgettable\nI Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978),\nand followed that effort with\nUsed Cars (1980), a critically\nacclaimed, but mostly forgotten,\nKurt Russell/Jack Warden\ncomedy about devious used-car dealers. Spielberg hit gold yet one more\ntime with\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981),\nwith Harrison Ford taking the part\nof Indiana Jones. Spielberg produced and directed two films in 1982.\nThe first was Poltergeist (1982), but\nthe highest-grossing movie of all time up to that point was the alien\nstory\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982).\nSpielberg also helped pioneer the practice of product placement. The\nconcept, while not uncommon, was still relatively low-key when\nSpielberg raised the practice to almost an art form with his famous (or\ninfamous) placement of Reese's Pieces in \"E.T.\" Spielberg was also one\nof the pioneers of the big-grossing special-effects movies, like \"E.T.\"\nand \"Close Encounters\", where a very strong emphasis on special effects\nwas placed for the first time on such a huge scale. In 1984, Spielberg\nfollowed up \"Raiders\" with\nIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984),\nwhich was a commercial success but did not receive the critical acclaim\nof its predecessor. As a producer, Spielberg took on many projects in\nthe 1980s, such as\nThe Goonies (1985), and was the\nbrains behind the little monsters in\nGremlins (1984). He also produced the\ncartoon\nAn American Tail (1986), a\nquaint little animated classic. His biggest effort as producer in 1985,\nhowever, was the blockbuster\nBack to the Future (1985),\nwhich made Michael J. Fox an\ninstant superstar. As director, Spielberg took on the book\nThe Color Purple (1985), with\nWhoopi Goldberg and\nOprah Winfrey, with great success. In the\nlatter half of the 1980s, he also directed\nEmpire of the Sun (1987), a\nmixed success for the occasionally erratic Spielberg. Success would not\nescape him for long, though.The late 1980s found Spielberg's projects at the center of pop-culture\nyet again. In 1988, he produced the landmark animation/live-action film\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).\nThe next year proved to be another big one for Spielberg, as he\nproduced and directed Always (1989) as\nwell as\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989),\nand\nBack to the Future Part II (1989).\nAll three of the films were box-office and critical successes. Also, in\n1989, he produced the little known comedy-drama\nDad (1989), with\nJack Lemmon and\nTed Danson, which got mostly mixed results.\nSpielberg has also had an affinity for animation and has been a strong\nvoice in animation in the 1990s. Aside from producing the landmark \"Who\nFramed Roger Rabbit\", he produced the animated series\nTiny Toon Adventures (1990),\nAnimaniacs (1993),\nPinky and the Brain (1995),\nFreakazoid! (1995),\nPinky, Elmyra & the Brain (1998),\nFamily Dog (1993) and\nToonsylvania (1998). Spielberg\nalso produced other cartoons such as\nThe Land Before Time (1988),\nWe're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993),\nCasper (1995) (the live action version) as\nwell as the live-action version of\nThe Flintstones (1994), where\nhe was credited as \"Steven Spielrock\". Spielberg also produced many\nRoger Rabbit short cartoons, and many Pinky and the Brain, Animaniacs\nand Tiny Toons specials. Spielberg was very active in the early 1990s,\nas he directed Hook (1991) and produced such\nfilms as the cute fantasy\nJoe Versus the Volcano (1990)\nand\nAn American Tail: Fievel Goes West (1991).\nHe also produced the unusual comedy thriller\nArachnophobia (1990),\nBack to the Future Part III (1990)\nand\nGremlins 2: The New Batch (1990).\nWhile these movies were big successes in their own right, they did not\nquite bring in the kind of box office or critical acclaim as previous\nefforts. In 1993, Spielberg directed\nJurassic Park (1993), which for a\nshort time held the record as the highest grossing movie of all time,\nbut did not have the universal appeal of his previous efforts. Big\nbox-office spectacles were not his only concern, though. He produced\nand directed\nSchindler's List (1993), a\nstirring film about the Holocaust. He won best director at the Oscars,\nand also got Best Picture. In the mid-90s, he helped found the\nproduction company DreamWorks, which was responsible for many\nbox-office successes.As a producer, he was very active in the late 90s, responsible for such\nfilms as\nThe Mask of Zorro (1998),\nMen in Black (1997) and\nDeep Impact (1998). However, it was\non the directing front that Spielberg was in top form. He directed and\nproduced the epic Amistad (1997), a\nspectacular film that was shorted at the Oscars and in release due to\nthe fact that its release date was moved around so much in late 1997.\nThe next year, however, produced what many believe was one of the best\nfilms of his career:\nSaving Private Ryan (1998), a\nfilm about World War Two that is spectacular in almost every respect.\nIt was stiffed at the Oscars, losing best picture to\nShakespeare in Love (1998).Spielberg produced a series of films, including\nEvolution (2001),\nThe Haunting (1999) and\nShrek (2001). he also produced two sequels\nto Jurassic Park (1993), which were\nfinancially but not particularly critical successes. In 2001, he\nproduced a mini-series about World War Two that definitely *was* a\nfinancial and critical success:\nBand of Brothers (2001), a\ntale of an infantry company from its parachuting into France during the\ninvasion to the Battle of the Bulge. Also in that year, Spielberg was\nback in the director's chair for\nA.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001),\na movie with a message and a huge budget. It did reasonably at the box\noffice and garnered varied reviews from critics.Spielberg has been extremely active in films there are many other\nthings he has done as well. He produced the short-lived TV series\nSeaQuest 2032 (1993), an\nanthology series entitled\nAmazing Stories (1985),\ncreated the video-game series \"Medal of Honor\" set during World War\nTwo, and was a starting producer of\nER (1994). Spielberg, if you haven't\nnoticed, has a great interest in World War Two. He and\nTom Hanks collaborated on\nShooting War: World War II Combat Cameramen (2000), a\ndocumentary about World War II combat photographers, and he produced a\ndocumentary about the Holocaust called\nEyes of the Holocaust (2000).\nWith all of this to Spielberg's credit, it's no wonder that he's looked\nat as one of the greatest ever figures in entertainment.",

        "bio": "Paola Núñez started acting when she was 12 years old. Seven years later she moved from her tiny town of Tecate, to Mexico City to begin her acting career. There she graduated from the acting school CEFAC.She immediately began working on day-time television serials, in commercial theater and feature films. In 2005, the role of Barbie Basterrica, a spoiled rich girl brought Paola international attention in her breakthrough lead role in \"Amor en Costodia\". The role was in large part developed and much of the dialogue even generated by Nuñez herself. Paola later admit that she was inspired by her take on high society girls in Mexico City. Her initial intention was to satire their obnoxious and selfish behavior. Paola was surprised when the fans embraced the character of Barbie. She was such a sensation that girls throughout Mexico began to dress and style their hair like her.Nuñez's career blossomed after that, playing leading roles in numerous television shows such as \"Passion Morena\" as well as feature films like \"Mexican Gangster\", \"Los Inadaptados\" and \"Dariela los Martes\", which was filmed in France, the US and Mexico and marked her debut as a film producer.Throughout her career her passion for live performance remained starring in such theater pieces as, \"Allen's Ball\", \"Five Women Wearing the Same Dress\", \"The Graduate\" and \"Rain Man\". Nuñez also produced large scale commercial theater shows such as \"Freud's Last Session\" and \"Aladdin\" in Mexico and Argentina. Perhaps one of her favorite endeavors in theatrical production was an intimate, two-hand, romance which toured all over Mexico called, \"Sumergibles (Submergibles)\" inspired by the tango \"Confesíon\".One of Paola's biggest career goals was to expand her horizons beyond the boarder of Mexico and In 2015 she moved to Los Angeles. A year later she achieved her goal playing Maria opposite Pierce Brosnan on AMC's series \"The Son\". The role gave her the opportunity to give a voice to the history and struggle of the first Mexican-Americans in the US.She has been spokesperson for such NGOs as Greenpeace, Save the Children and Animal Heroes.Despite her success, Paola enjoys her privacy, preferring the outdoors, family and close friends to the red carpet. She has admitted that life in the lime-light can be a lonely place.She appreciates that her success is something of a paradox. Her initial attraction to the craft grew out of the performer's ability hide behind a character totally unlike themselves. For Nuñez performance was a place to be anonymous.",

        "bio": "Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for playing wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD.Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene Kassel, and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \"discovered\" whilst working in a café in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role.After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \"David Addison\" alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Moonlighting (1985). His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \"John McClane\" in the monster hit Die Hard (1988), in which Willis' character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel, Die Hard 2 (1990), set at a snowbound Washington's Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), this time co-starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shop owner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in New York.Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice\nof \"Mikey\" the baby in the very popular family comedies Look Who's Talking (1989), and its sequel Look Who's Talking Too (1990) also starring John Travolta and\nKirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) and Hudson Hawk (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyper-violent\nThe Last Boy Scout (1991), the darkly humored Death Becomes Her (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Striking Distance (1993).During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing North (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in\nthe Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Pulp Fiction (1994), the\nTerry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller 12 Monkeys (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus The Fifth Element (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic The Sixth Sense (1999).Willis next starred in the gangster comedy The Whole Nine Yards (2000),\nworked again with \"hot\" director M. Night Shyamalan in the less than\ngripping Unbreakable (2000), and in two military dramas, Hart's War (2002)\nand Tears of the Sun (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically\napplauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Sin City (2005), the voice of \"RJ\" the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Over the Hedge (2006) and \"Die Hard\" fans rejoiced to see \"John McClane\" return to the big screen in\nthe high tech Live Free or Die Hard (2007) aka \"Die Hard 4.0\".Willis was married to actress Demi Moore for approximately thirteen years and they share custody to their three daughters.",

Not until he was 16, and his father became head of the McCarter Theater in Princeton New Jersey, did the family settle down. But for John, the theater was still not a career. He won a scholarship to Harvard University, where he finally caught the acting bug (as well as found a wife). Harvard was followed by a Fulbright scholarship to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Returning from London, his rigorous dramatic training stood him in good stead, and a distinguished career on Broadway gave him one Tony Award for \"The Changing Room\", a second nomination in 1985 for \"Requiem For a Heavyweight\", and a third in 1988 for \"M. Butterfly\". But with critical acclaim came personal confusion, and in the mid 1970s, he and his wife divorced. He entered therapy, and in 1982, his life started in a new direction, the movies - he received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Roberta Muldoon in The World According to Garp (1982). A second Oscar nomination followed for Terms of Endearment (1983), and he met a UCLA economics professor who became his second wife. As the decade of the 1990s came around, he found that he was spending too much time on location, and another career move brought him to television in the hugely successful series 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996).This production also played a role in bringing him back together with the son from his first marriage, Ian Lithgow, who has a regular role in the series as a dimwitted student.",

        "bio": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born in Concord, California, to Janet Marylyn (Frager), a hospital worker, and Amos Mefford Hanks, an itinerant cook. His mother's family, originally surnamed \"Fraga\", was entirely Portuguese, while his father was of mostly English ancestry. Tom grew up in what he has called a \"fractured\" family. He moved around a great deal after his parents' divorce, living with a succession of step-families. No problems, no alcoholism - just a confused childhood. He has no acting experience in college and credits the fact that he could not get cast in a college play with actually starting his career. He went downtown, and auditioned for a community theater play, was invited by the director of that play to go to Cleveland, and there his acting career started.Ron Howard was working on Splash (1983), a fantasy-comedy about a mermaid who falls in love with a business executive. Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, which eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role and the film went on to become a surprise box office success, grossing more than $69 million. After several flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet (1987), Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success with the fantasy-comedy Big (1988) established him as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the film industry as an actor. For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first Academy Award nomination as Best Actor.Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of movie making ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle (1993) and then with Philadelphia (1993). The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. Richard Schickel of Time magazine called his performance \"charming\", and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.In Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.Hanks followed Philadelphia with the blockbuster Forrest Gump (1994) which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office. Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.Hanks' next role - astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the docudrama Apollo 13 (1995) - reunited him with Ron Howard. Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's computer-animated film Toy Story (1995), as the voice of Sheriff Woody. A year later, he made his directing debut with the musical comedy That Thing You Do! (1996) about the rise and fall of a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.As of 2022, Hanks is 66-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and has remained active in the film industry for more than four decades.",

He was raised in the neighborhood of Little Italy, which later provided the inspiration for several of his films. Scorsese earned a B.S. degree in film communications in 1964, followed by an M.A. in the same field in 1966 at New York University's School of Film. During this time, he made numerous prize-winning short films including The Big Shave (1967), and directed his first feature film, Who's That Knocking at My Door (1967).He served as assistant director and an editor of the documentary Woodstock (1970) and won critical and popular acclaim for Mean Streets (1973), which first paired him with actor and frequent collaborator Robert De Niro. In 1976, Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), also starring De Niro, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and he followed that film with New York, New York (1977) and The Last Waltz (1978). Scorsese directed De Niro to an Oscar-winning performance as boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull (1980), which received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, and is hailed as one of the masterpieces of modern cinema. Scorsese went on to direct The Color of Money (1986), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), The Age of Innocence (1993), Casino (1995) and Kundun (1997), among other films.

Scorsese won his first Academy Award for Best Director for The Departed (2006), which was also honored with the Director's Guild of America, Golden Globe, New York Film Critics, National Board of Review and Critic's Choice awards for Best Director, in addition to four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Scorsese's documentary of the Rolling Stones in concert, Shine a Light (2008), followed, with the successful thriller Shutter Island (2010) two years later. Scorsese received his seventh Academy Award nomination for Best Director, as well as a Golden Globe Award, for Hugo (2011), which went on to win five Academy Awards.Scorsese also serves as executive producer on the HBO series Boardwalk Empire (2010) for which he directed the pilot episode. Scorsese's additional awards and honors include the Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival (1995), the AFI Life Achievement Award (1997), the Honoree at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's 25th Gala Tribute (1998), the DGA Lifetime Achievement Award (2003), The Kennedy Center Honors (2007) and the HFPA Cecil B.

His father\nwas of German and Irish descent, and his mother was of Irish ancestry.\nRaised in Louisville, Kentucky, at the age of seventeen, young Jack Lebzelter\nwas expelled from Louisville's DuPont Manual High School for repeatedly\nfighting. Good with his fists, he turned professional, boxing as a\nwelterweight under the name \"Johnny Costello\", adopting his mother's\nmaiden name. The purses were poor, so he soon left the ring and worked\nas a bouncer at a night club. He also worked as a lifeguard before\nsigning up with the U.S. Navy in 1938. He served in China with the\nYangtze River Patrol for the best part of his three-year hitch before\njoining the Merchant Marine in 1941.Though the Merchant Marine paid better than the Navy, Warden was\ndissatisfied with his life aboard ship on the long convoy runs and quit\nin 1942 in order to enlist in the U.S. Army. He became a paratrooper\nwith the elite 101st Airborne Division, and missed the June 1944\ninvasion of Normandy due to a leg badly broken by landing on a fence\nduring a nighttime practice jump shortly before D-Day. Many of his\ncomrades lost their lives during the Normandy invasion, but the future\nJack Warden was spared that ordeal. Recuperating from his injuries, he\nread a play by Clifford Odets given to\nhim by a fellow soldier who was an actor in civilian life. He was so\nmoved by the play, he decided to become an actor after the war. After\nrecovering from his badly shattered leg, Warden saw action at the\nBattle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany's last major offensive. He was\ndemobilized with the rank of sergeant and decided to pursue an acting\ncareer on the G.I. Bill. He moved to New York City to attend acting\nschool, then joined the company of Theatre\n'47 in Dallas in 1947 as\na professional actor, taking his middle name as his surname.\nThis repertory company, run by\nMargo Jones,\nbecame famous in the 1940s and '50s for producing Tennessee Williams's\nplays. The experience gave him a valuable grounding in both classic and\ncontemporary drama, and he shuttled between Texas and New York for five\nyears as he was in demand as an actor. Warden made his television debut\nin 1948, though he continued to perform on stage (he appeared in a\nstage production in\nArthur Miller's\nDeath of a Salesman (1966)).\nAfter several years in small, local productions, he made both his\nBroadway debut in the 1952 Broadway revival of Odets' \"Golden Boy\" and,\nthree years later, originated the role of \"Marco\" in the original\nBroadway production of Miller's \"A View From the Bridge\". On film, he\nand fellow World War II veteran,\nLee Marvin (Marine Corps, South\nPacific), made their debut in\nYou're in the Navy Now (1951)\n(a.k.a. \"U.S.S. Teakettle\"), uncredited, along with fellow vet\nCharles Bronson, then billed as\n\"Charles Buchinsky\".With his athletic physique, he was routinely cast in bit parts as\nsoldiers (including the sympathetic barracks-mate of\nMontgomery Clift and\nFrank Sinatra in the Oscar-winning\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953).\nHe played the coach on TV's\nMister Peepers (1952) with\nWally Cox.Aside from\nFrom Here to Eternity (1953)\n(The Best Picture Oscar winner for 1953), other famous roles in the\n1950s included Juror #7 (a disinterested salesman who wants a quick\nconviction to get the trial over with) in\n12 Angry Men (1957) - a film that\nproved to be his career breakthrough - the bigoted foreman in\nEdge of the City (1957) and one\nof the submariners commended by\nClark Gable and\nBurt Lancaster in the World War II drama,\nRun Silent Run Deep (1958).\nIn 1959, Warden capped off the decade with a memorable appearance in\nThe Twilight Zone (1959)\nepisode,\nThe Lonely (1959),\nin the series premier year of 1959. As \"James Corry\", Warden created a\nsensitive portrayal of a convicted felon marooned on an asteroid,\nsentenced to serve a lifetime sentence, who falls in love with a robot.\nIt was a character quite different from his role as Juror #7.In the 1960s and early 70s, his most memorable work was on television,\nplaying a detective in\nThe Asphalt Jungle (1961),\nThe Wackiest Ship in the Army (1965)\nand N.Y.P.D. (1967). He opened up\nthe decade of the 1970s by winning an Emmy Award playing football coach\n\"George Halas\" in\nBrian's Song (1971), the\nhighly-rated and acclaimed TV movie based on\nGale Sayers's memoir, \"I Am Third\". He\nappeared again as a detective in the TV series,\nJigsaw John (1976), in the\nmid-1970s,\nThe Bad News Bears (1979)\nand appeared in a pilot for a planned revival of\nTopper (1937) in 1979.His collaboration with\nWarren Beatty in two 1970s films\nbrought him to the summit of his career as he displayed a flair for\ncomedy in both Shampoo (1975) and\nHeaven Can Wait (1978). As the\nfaintly sinister businessman \"Lester\" and as the perpetually befuddled\nfootball trainer \"Max Corkle\", Warden received Academy Award\nnominations as Best Supporting Actor. Other memorable roles in the\nperiod were as the metro news editor of the \"Washington Post\" in\nAll the President's Men (1976),\nthe German doctor in\nDeath on the Nile (1978), the\nsenile, gun-toting judge in\nAnd Justice for All (1979),\nthe President of the United States in\nBeing There (1979), the twin car\nsalesmen in Used Cars (1980) and\nPaul Newman's law partner in\nThe Verdict (1982).This was the peak of Warden's career, as he entered his early sixties.\nHe single-handedly made\nAndrew Bergman's\nSo Fine (1981) watchable, but after that\nfilm, the quality of his roles declined. He made a third stab at TV,\nagain appearing as a detective in\nCrazy Like a Fox (1984) in\nthe mid-1980s. He played the shifty convenience store owner \"Big Ben\"\nin Problem Child (1990) and its two\nsequels, a role unworthy of his talent, but he shone again as the\nBroadway high-roller \"Julian Marx\" in\nWoody Allen's\nBullets Over Broadway (1994).\nAfter appearing in Warren Beatty's\nBulworth (1998), Warden's last film was\nThe Replacements (2000) in 2000.\nHe then lived in retirement in New York City with his girlfriend,\nMarucha Hinds. He was married to French stage actress\nWanda Ottoni, best known for her role as\nthe object of Joe Besser's desire in\nThe Three Stooges short,\nFifi Blows Her Top (1958).

        "bio": "Often mistaken for an American because of his skill at imitating\naccents, actor Tim Roth was born Timothy Simon Roth on May 14, 1961 in Lambeth, London, England. His mother, Ann, was a teacher and landscape painter. His father, Ernie, was a journalist who had changed the family name from \"Smith\" to\n\"Roth\"; Ernie was born in Brooklyn, New York, to an immigrant family of\nIrish ancestry.Tim grew up in Dulwich, a middle-class area in the south of London. He\ndemonstrated his talent for picking up accents at an early age when he\nattended school in Brixton, where he faced persecution from classmates\nfor his comfortable background and quickly perfected a cockney accent\nto blend in. He attended Camberwell Art College and studied sculpture\nbefore he dropped out and pursued acting.The blonde actor's first big break was the British TV movie\nMade in Britain (1982).\nRoth made a huge splash in that film as a young skinhead named Trevor.\nHe next worked with director\nMike Leigh on\nMeantime (1983), which he has\ncounted among his favorite projects. He debuted on the big screen when\nhe filled in for Joe Strummer in the\nStephen Frears neo-noir\nThe Hit (1984). Roth gained more\nattention for his turn as Vincent Van Gogh in\nVincent & Theo (1990) and his work\nopposite Gary Oldman in\nRosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990).He moved to Los Angeles in search of work and caught the eye of young\ndirector Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino\nhad envisioned Roth as a possible Mr. Blonde or Mr. Pink in his heist\nflick Reservoir Dogs (1992), but\nRoth campaigned for the role of Mr. Orange instead, and ultimately won\nthe part. It proved to be a huge breakthrough for Roth, as audiences\nfound it difficult to forget his performance as a member of a group of\njewelry store robbers who is slowly bleeding to death. Tarantino cast\nRoth again in the landmark film\nPulp Fiction (1994). Roth and\nactress Amanda Plummer played a pair of\nrobbers who hold up a restaurant. 1995 saw the third of Roth's\ncollaborations with Tarantino, a surprisingly slapstick performance in\nthe anthology film Four Rooms (1995).\nThat same year Roth picked up an Academy Award nomination for his campy\nturn as a villain in the period piece\nRob Roy (1995).Continuing to take on disparate roles, Roth did his own singing (with\nan American accent to boot) in the lightweight\nWoody Allen musical\nEveryone Says I Love You (1996).\nHe starred opposite Tupac Shakur in\nShakur's last film, the twisted comedy\nGridlock'd (1997). The pair received\npositive critical notices for their comic chemistry. Standing in\ncontrast to the criminals and baddies that crowd his CV, Roth's work as\nthe innocent, seafaring pianist in the\nGiuseppe Tornatore film\nThe Legend of 1900 (1998)\nbecame something of a fan favorite. Grittier fare followed when Roth\nmade his directorial debut with\nThe War Zone (1999), a frank,\ncritically acclaimed drama about a family torn apart by incest. He made\nhis next high-profile appearance as an actor as General Thade, an evil\nsimian in the Tim Burton remake of\nPlanet of the Apes (2001).\nRoth was, of course, all but unrecognizable in his primate make-up.Roth has continued to enjoy a mix of art house and mainstream work,\nincluding everything from the lead role in\nFrancis Ford Coppola's esoteric\nYouth Without Youth (2007) to\nbecoming \"The Abomination\" in the special effects-heavy blockbuster\nThe Incredible Hulk (2008).\nRoth took his first major American television role when he signed on to\nthe Fox-TV series Lie to Me (2009)",

        "bio": "David Michael Bautista, Jr. was born on January 18, 1969 in Washington, D.C., to Donna Raye (Mullins) and David Michael Bautista, a hairdresser. He has Filipino and Greek ancestry.When WCW officials told him he'd never make it in sports entertainment, Bautista pushed himself to achieve his dream of being a Superstar. In May 2002, he made his debut on SmackDown using the ring name Batista, but it wasn't until a move to Raw and two victories over Kane that \"The Animal\" began to make noise in the WWE Universe. The wins impressed Ric Flair and Triple H, who were looking to align themselves with the industry's brightest new stars. After a lengthy search, they identified Randy Orton and Batista. Collectively the four Superstars became known as Evolution.Batista earned his first championship alongside \"The Nature Boy\" when the duo captured the WWE Tag Team Championships in December 2003. As Evolution dominated WWE, Batista started to emerge from the shadows of Triple H and Ric Flair. By the time Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble Match, World Heavyweight Champion Triple H viewed him as a serious threat to his title.After a triceps injury at the hands of Mark Henry forced Batista to relinquish the title in January 2006, he vowed to return. Batista successfully regained the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series in 2006. Four months into his second reign, Batista faced the Undertaker at WrestleMania 23. \"The Animal\" took Undertaker to the limit, but was unable to stop the streak of \"The Deadman\" at WrestleMania. Though disappointed, Batista stayed hungry and always managed to keep himself in the championship hunt for the rest of his career.At Bragging Rights in 2009, Batista shocked the world when he blamed Rey Mysterio for a loss to Undertaker, then attacked his former tag team partner. \"The Animal\" then became locked in a tense rivalry with another former friend, John Cena, over the WWE Championship. The grueling match at Over the Limit led to a wheelchair-bound Batista declaring \"I quit!\" the following night on Raw before fading from the WWE Universe in May 2010. Following his departure from WWE, Bautista appeared opposite Vin Diesel in the Universal film Riddick (2013) and RZA's feature directorial debut The Man with the Iron Fists (2012), in which he played the villainous Brass Body and starred opposite Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu. His other film credits include The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption (2012), where he played Argomael; the action film House of the Rising Sun (2011); and Wrong Side of Town (2010) opposite rapper Ja Rule.Two years later, he joined MMA and won his first professional MMA fight. In January 2014, he made his long awaited return to the WWE, before quitting a second time in June of that same year. He did this in order to promote Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), which was released on August 1, 2014, and starred Chris Pratt, Benicio Del Toro, Zoe Saldana, and Djimon Hounsou, alongside Bautista.He will shoot Kickboxer: Vengeance (2016), directed by John Stockwell, and co-starring martial artist Alain Moussi and UFC fighter Georges St-Pierre. The remake of the 1989 Jean-Claude Van Damme film, Kickboxer (1989) is about two brothers David and Kurt Sloan; When David wins the Karate World Championship, a promoter lures him to Hong Kong, despite his brother's protestations that the man is a crook. When Kurt travels to Thailand to meet his brother, he discovers he has died and seeks his revenge.After starring in films such as, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017), Blade Runner 2049 (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Hotel Artemis (2018), Escape Plan 2: Hades (2018), and Final Score (2018), he made a special guest appearance on WWE Smackdown! (1999) for it's 1000 episode reuniting with his former Evolution members Triple H, Randy Orton, and Ric Flair on October 16, 2018. The following year on February 25, 2019, he made his return to WWE Raw (1993) when he attacked Ric Flair on his 70th birthday at the end of the episode sending a message to Triple H that would ultimately lead to a No Holds Barred match for WrestleMania 35 (2019). Batista added the stipulation that if he wins the match, Triple H will have to retire from in-ring competition. As a result, Triple H was finally able to beat Batista for the first time and won the match, which ultimately led to Batista announcing his official retirement from wrestling in the WWE. Following his retirement, he will continue with his career as an actor in Hollywood.His next films scheduled for release will be; Stuber (2019), Avengers: Endgame (2019), Escape Plan: The Extractors (2019), and My Spy (2020). He is one of many professional wrestlers to make the smooth transition from wrestling into the entertainment world.",

As a teenager, he worked as an apprentice puppeteer at Children's Fairyland amusement park. He is one of the primary puppeteers responsible for the development of Jim Henson's Sesame Street (1969) and The Muppet Show (1976) as well as over 75 other Muppet productions. George Lucas originally contacted Henson to play the part of Yoda in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980), but he recommended Oz for the part instead. He developed the character's trademark syntax, returning to voice and puppet the Jedi Master in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999).Oz voiced the computer-generated Yoda in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005), supporting the transition of the character's rendering to digital. In 2011, the Blu-Ray edition of The Phantom Menace replaced the puppet Yoda with CGI to match the other prequel films.He began a career of behind-the-camera puppet and live action filmmaking by co-directing The Dark Crystal (1982) with Henson. He went on to direct The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984), Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), What About Bob? (1991), The Indian in the Cupboard (1995), Bowfinger (1999), The Score (2001), The Stepford Wives (2004) and Death at a Funeral (2007).",

        "bio": "Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \"cool breeze over the mountains\" in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patric Reeves, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu's father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu's mother is originally from Essex England. After his parents' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \"The Wall\") and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career.After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Youngblood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, River's Edge (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Dangerous Liaisons (1988) with director Stephen Frears.His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \"Theodore\" Logan in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves's real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard's comedy, Parenthood (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death (1990).Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix's narcoleptic male hustler in My Own Private Idaho (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire's lair in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Much Ado About Nothing (1993).In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Speed (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Feeling Minnesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and The Devil's Advocate (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too:\nJohnny Mnemonic (1995) and Chain Reaction (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings' cyberadventure, The Matrix (1999).Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them The Replacements (2000), The Watcher (2000), The Gift (2000), Sweet November (2001), and Hardball (2001) - before The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003) were both released in 2003.Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Something's Gotta Give (2003), The Lake House (2006), and Street Kings (2008). He's kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Constantine (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008). And he's waded back into art-house territory with Ellie Parker (2005), Thumbsucker (2005), The Private Lives of Pippa Lee (2009), and Henry's Crime (2010).Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Ronin (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Man of Tai Chi (2013).In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film John Wick (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.",

On films from as early as 1932, he was at his most effective\nportraying eccentrics, scientists, small-time crooks, alcoholics, or\nnervous, downtrodden little men. His particular forte lay in the genre\nof science-fiction, where he graced the small screen on numerous\noccasions as assorted victims\n(The Outer Limits (1963),\nThe Time Tunnel (1966),\nThe Invaders (1967)) or aliens\n(Lost in Space (1965),\nStar Trek (1966),\nThe Twilight Zone (1959)).\nHis occasional film appearances include a dementia patent in\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)\nand a rare starring role in the black comedy\nHomebodies (1974), late in his career.\nAs a liberal-minded individual, Brocco was briefly blacklisted during\nthe McCarthy era, but this did not prove detrimental to his career in\nthe long run.",

He was educated at Tonbridge School and trained\nin acting at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain. He studied\nEnglish Literature at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Whilst he was a\nCambridge undergraduate, he acted in several student drama productions.\nHe played the title role in the Marlowe Dramatic Society's production\nof William Shakespeare's\nplay, \"Macbeth\". This was staged at the Cambridge Arts Theatre from\nTuesday 26th February to Saturday 2nd March 2002. The cast also\nfeatured Rebecca Hall in the roles\nof Lady Macbeth and Hecate. During one of his university summer\nholidays in August 2003 he went to Slovakia where he filmed his scenes\nfor the Hallmark production of\nFrankenstein (2004). Dan played\nthe part of Henry Clerval and the mini-series was first broadcast on\nAmerican television on 5th October 2004. Shortly after graduating from\nCambridge Dan was nominated for an Ian Charleson award for his\nperformance as Orlando in \"As You Like It\" at the Rose Theatre at\nKingston in Surrey. \"As You Like It\" was directed by\nPeter Hall and ran from 30th November\nto 18th December 2004. This production for the Peter Hall Company\nsubsequently went on a tour of America in the early months of 2005,\nplaying at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Curran Theater in\nSan Francisco and the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music\nin New York City. It featured\nRebecca Hall in the role of\nRosalind.Dan was reunited with the director\nPeter Hall when he played Claudio in\na new production of the Shakespeare play, \"Much Ado About Nothing\", for\nthe Peter Hall Company at the Theatre Royal in Bath from 29th June to\n6th August 2005. In February 2006 Dan played the parts of Marban and\nMaitland in a revival of Howard Brenton's\ncontroversial play, \"The Romans in Britain\", directed by\nSamuel West at the Crucible Theatre\nin Sheffield. Then in May 2006 he played Nick Guest, the protagonist in\nThe Line of Beauty (2006).\nThis three part television mini-series was adapted by\nAndrew Davies from the 2004 Booker\nprize winning novel by\nAlan Hollinghurst.\nThe Line of Beauty (2006)\nis about Nick Guest's relationship with his university friend Toby\nFedden. The story takes place in the 1980s. It is set against the\nbackdrop of Margaret Thatcher's free market economic policies and the\nspread of the acquired immunity deficiency syndrome, (AIDS). These two\nsocial developments directly affect the characters in the story because\nToby's father Gerald is a Conservative member of parliament and Nick is\nhomosexual.Whilst\nThe Line of Beauty (2006)\nwas being broadcast on BBC television, Dan was appearing as Simon Bliss\nin the Noël Coward play, \"Hay Fever\". This\nplay was staged at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London from 11th\nApril to 5th August 2006 and the cast also included\nJudi Dench in the role of Judith Bliss. At\nthe end of the year Dan played Lord Holmwood in a television\ndramatization of\nDracula (2006), which was\nbroadcast on 28th December 2006. In 2007 Dan played the part of Michael\nFaber in\nMiss Marple: Nemesis (2007),\nan Agatha Christie adaptation with\nGeraldine McEwan in the role of Miss\nJane Marple. He also featured in the cast of\nMaxwell (2007), a television\ndrama about the famous newspaper magnate.\nMaxwell (2007) was first\nbroadcast on British television on 4th May 2007.\nDavid Suchet played Robert Maxwell, and Dan\ntook the part of Basil Brookes, one of the press baron's financial\ndirectors.Dan played the part of Edward Ferrars in a television dramatization of\nJane Austen's novel,\nSense & Sensibility (2008).\nThis was broadcast in three episodes on BBC1 between Tuesday 1st and\nSunday 13th January 2008. The novel was adapted for television by\nAndrew Davies, whom Dan had\npreviously worked with on\nThe Line of Beauty (2006).\nDavies felt that the part of Edward Ferrars was underdeveloped in the\nbook, and so he deliberately added scenes not included in the novel to\nhelp draw out the character. So, for instance, we saw Edward out horse\nriding on the Norland estate and chopping logs at Barton Cottage. In\nthe DVD audio commentary Dan joked that this was the best example of\nlog chopping ever seen on British television! After\nSense & Sensibility (2008),\nDan featured in the cast of \"The Tennis Court\", a BBC Radio 4 Saturday\nplay broadcast on 19th January 2008. He also played Nicky Lancaster in\na revival of the Noël Coward play, \"The\nVortex\", at the Apollo Theatre in London from Wednesday 20th February\nto Saturday 7th June 2008. This was another collaboration with the\nstage director, Peter Hall. Dan\nplayed the eponymous hero of \"Dickens Confidential\", a six part radio\ndrama series set in the 1830s which imagines what might have happened\nif Charles Dickens had continued his\ncareer as a journalist.

        "bio": "James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, to Elizabeth Ruth (Johnson) and Alexander Maitland Stewart, who owned a hardware store. He was of Scottish, Ulster-Scots, and some English descent. Stewart was educated at a local prep school, Mercersburg Academy, where he was a keen athlete (football and track), musician (singing and accordion playing), and sometime actor.In 1929, he won a place at Princeton University, where he studied architecture with some success and became further involved with the performing arts as a musician and actor with the University Players. After graduation, engagements with the University Players took him around the northeastern United States, including a run on Broadway in 1932. But work dried up as the Great Depression deepened, and it was not until 1934, when he followed his friend Henry Fonda to Hollywood, that things began to pick up.After his first screen appearance in Art Trouble (1934), Stewart worked for a time for MGM as a contract player and slowly began making a name for himself in increasingly high-profile roles throughout the rest of the 1930s. His famous collaborations with Frank Capra, in You Can't Take It with You (1938), Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), and, after World War II, It's a Wonderful Life (1946) helped to launch his career as a star and to establish his screen persona as the likable everyman.Having learned to fly in 1935, he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940 as a private (after twice failing the medical for being underweight). During the course of World War II, he rose to the rank of colonel, first as an instructor at home in the United States, and later on combat missions in Europe. He remained involved with the United States Air Force Reserve after the war and officially retired in 1968. In 1959, he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the highest-ranking actor in U.S. military history.Stewart's acting career took off properly after the war. During the course of his long professional life, he had roles in some of Hollywood's best-remembered films, starring in a string of Westerns, bringing his everyman qualities to movies like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)), biopics (The Stratton Story (1949), The Glenn Miller Story (1954), and The Spirit of St. Louis (1957), for instance, thrillers (most notably his frequent collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock), and even some screwball comedies.On June 25, 1997, a thrombosis formed in his right leg, leading to a pulmonary embolism, and a week later on July 2, 1997, surrounded by his children, James Stewart died at age 89 at his home in Beverly Hills, California. His last words to his family were, \"I'm going to be with Gloria now\".",

Grew up in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., and Maine. Though very poor, attended prep school at Wassookeag School in Dexter, Maine. Ran away to sea at 17, first as ship's boy, then as doryman on the Grand Banks, as a seaman and fireman on numerous vessels before getting his first command at 19. He sailed around the world a number of times, becoming a well-known and highly respected ship's captain. At urging of friends, met with producer Edward H. Griffith who signs him to a Paramount contract. Fell for his first leading lady, Madeleine Carroll, and married her. Prior to Pearl Harbor, abandoned Hollywood to become a commando with the COI (later the OSS). Joined Marines under pseudonym \"John Hamilton\" (a name he never acts under), eventually running guns and supplies to Yugoslav partisans through the German blockade of the Adriatic, as well as parachuting into Croatia for guerrilla activities. Won Silver Star and citation from Tito of Yugoslavia. Briefly flirted with Communist Party membership due to friendship with Yugoslav Communists. Returned to film work, which he despised, in order to pay for a succession of sailing vessels. As Red Scare deepens in U.S., he cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee, confessing his brief Communist ties. Ever after regretted this action, holding himself in enormous\ncontempt for what he considered \"ratting\". Offered role of Tarzan as replacement for Lex Barker, but refused. Made headlines defying court order not to sail to Tahiti with his children following divorce decree. Published autobiography \"Wanderer\" in 1963, and novel \"Voyage\" in 1976, both to great acclaim. Cast as Quint in Jaws (1975) but unable to play due to tax problems. Died of cancer in 1986.",

From mining the neuroses of characters for both dramatic and comedic effect, to producing work as a filmmaker with a superlative eye and keen wit, Goldberg has solidified his standing as a unique and prolific presence in the entertainment industry.Goldberg is a co-star on the hit CBS series \"The Equalizer.\" The show, a re imagining of the classic series and films, follows Robyn McCall (Queen Latifah), an enigmatic woman with a mysterious background who uses her extensive skills to help those with nowhere else to turn. Goldberg is a standout as whip smart, sardonic, and surprisingly fashion conscious computer hacker Harry Keshegian, who is like a brother to McCall and a fiercely supportive husband to his sniper wife Mel (Liza Lapira). \"The Equalizer\" had a massive debut to over 23 million viewers in 2021 and is currently airing its third season. Brand new episodes will return February 19, 2023, on CBS.Also in television, Goldberg gained critical acclaim and fostered in a new generation of fans as Mr. Numbers in the award-winning crime drama \"Fargo\" (FX). He starred opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Colin Hanks on the show, which was inspired by the 1996 film of the same name. Goldberg is also known for his tour de force arcs as Crazy Eddie on \"Friends\" (NBC) and Nicky Rubinstein on \"Entourage\" (HBO), as well as starring roles on \"The Jim Gaffigan Show,\" \"Taken\" (NBC),(NBC), \"The Unusuals\" (ABC), \"NYC 22\" (CBS), \"The $treet\" (FOX), and \"God Friended Me\" (CBS).Often recognized for his impressive body of work in film, Goldberg has been hand-picked by Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard for memorable roles in their Academy Award winning projects. A career-changing moment for Goldberg was landing the role of tough, wise-cracking infantryman Private Mellish in Steven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" opposite Tom Hanks. The film went on to receive 5 Academy Awards while also being nominated for Best Picture. From there, he starred in major blockbusters including Academy Award winner \"A Beautiful Mind\" which marked his second collaboration with director Ron Howard. In 2003 he showcased his talent in comedy, appearing a third time opposite Matthew McConaughey, in \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\"Other seminal performances include playing Christopher Walken's undead and unwitting assistant, Jerry, in Gregrory Widen's cult thriller \"The Prophecy,\" Michael Rapaport's beleaguered roommate in John Singleton's \"Higher Learning,\" appearing in Ron Howard's \"EdTV,\" and portraying a speed freak opposite Val Kilmer and Peter Sarsgaard in DJ Caruso's debut \"The Salton Sea.\" Additional recent work includes starring opposite Bruce Willis and John Goodman in \"Once Upon a Time in Venice,\" and appearing alongside Nicholas Cage and Laurence Fishburne in \"Running with the Devil.\" A filmmaker's actor, Goldberg also appeared, notably, in Tony Scott's \"Déjà Vu\" opposite Denzel Washington, and in David Fincher's \"Zodiac.\"Goldberg is known for effortlessly jumping back and forth between mainstream film and television roles with acclaimed passion projects. Namely, the titular role in Jonathan Kesselman's 'Jewxploitation' comedy, \"The Hebrew Hammer,\" his hilarious collaboration with Julie Delpy in \"2 Days in Paris,\" and his portrayal of a brilliant but eccentric musician in the art world satire \"(Untitled)\" opposite Marley Shelton. Other standouts include his turn as a performance artist opposite Olivia Thirlby in Rafael Palacio Illingworth's \"Between Us,\" and a cult leader who indoctrinates Fran Kranz in the Netflix thriller \"Rebirth,\" both of which premiered the same year at the Tribeca Film Festival.Born in Santa Monica and raised in LA, Goldberg loved to perform and create from an early age, taking acting classes and studying film and photography since secondary school. His debut in the entertainment industry came with supporting film role in Billy Crystal's \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" but it was his turn as Mike, an intellectual with a chip on his shoulder, in Richard Linklater's iconic, '70s coming of age classic \"Dazed and Confused\" that introduced Goldberg to an audience that continues to grow as the film captivates new audiences with each generation. Linklater would later make a cameo in Goldberg's directorial debut, \"Scotch and Milk,\" and later host a screening at Austin's Alamo Draft House the same summer Goldberg appeared in Linklater's groundbreaking, psychedelic animation feature, \"Waking Life.\"Goldberg wrote, directed, starred in, and co-edited \"Scotch and Milk\" when he was just 24 years old. The stylized black and white film follows a group of young jazz obsessed hipsters trying to reconcile their machismo with their sensitivity. Additionally, Goldberg screened a rough cut for Spielberg during the making of \"Saving Private Ryan,\" which led Spielberg to enlist his post production supervisor to help finish the film. \"Scotch and Milk\" debuted at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival and earned critical acclaim on the festival circuit. This included a particular notable write up in American Cinematography Magazine and featured on the Sundance Channel series \"10 Best Films You May Have Never Seen.\"Goldberg would go on to co-write the psychological drama \"I Love Your Work,\" starring frequent collaborator Giovanni Ribisi, and featuring Franka Potente, Christina Ricci, and Joshua Jackson. The film follows an actor whose life goes south after he forms an obsession with a young film student. Goldberg composed and arranged music for the film alongside The Flaming Lips' multi-instrumentalist Steven Drozd, and it debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival where the film was picked up for theatrical distribution. He also directed, co-edited, and produced the surreal documentary short \"Running with the Bulls\" for the Independent Film Channel, and most recently co-wrote, directed, edited, and starred in the Sony feature film \"No Way Jose,\" in which he plays a washed-up indie rocker going through a midlife crisis.While working in film and television has been a huge part of Goldberg's life, his passion for photography and music have garnered their own cult following over the years, establishing him something of a modern day renaissance man. As a musician, Goldberg has recorded four albums under his moniker The Goldberg Sisters - two of which he recorded with a an eclectic array of musicians, and the last two of which he recorded in his home studio playing every instrument. As part of his 2018, 14-track album entitled \"HOME: A Nice Place to Visit\" Goldberg released a limited edition vinyl set that included a stunning large-format photo book, marrying his love for soundscapes and photography. Goldberg also directed the accompanying videos. Show Gallery in Los Angeles hosted an exhibition of the work where Goldberg played some of the tracks from the record utilizing loop pedals and other effects. The Goldberg Sisters discography also includes: Stranger's Morning (2013), The Goldberg Sisters (2011), and Landy (2009). https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-goldberg-sisters/422885644As a photographer Goldberg's signature dreamy, double exposures shot on film document and explore people, landscapes, and create cinematic scenes from which viewers can draw their own interpretations. Goldberg is also known for his style and passion for fashion, which he attributes to his mom with whom he used to go vintage clothes shopping on Melrose in the '80s. Any follower of his Instagram will take note of his extensive tagging of small brands, bespoke makers, and his support of slow fashion writ large. Everything he wears on \"The Equalizer\" - clothes and accessories - are either straight out of Goldberg's closet (a dedicated room in his house, he's not proud of this, nor is his wife thrilled) or handpicked by the actor.Goldberg currently divides his time between Los Angeles and New York with his wife and two sons.###",

He has three younger siblings. Murphy was educated at Presentation Brothers College, Cork. He went on to study law at University College Cork, but dropped out after about a year. During this time, Murphy also pursued an interest in music, playing guitar in various bands. Upon leaving University, Murphy joined the Corcadorca Theater Company in Cork, and played the lead role in \"Disco Pigs\", amongst other plays.Various film roles followed, including a film adaptation of Disco Pigs (2001). However, his big film break came when he was cast in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later (2002), which became a surprise international hit. This performance earned him nominations for Best Newcomer at the Empire Awards and Breakthrough Male Performance at the MTV Movie Awards.Murphy went on to supporting roles in high-profile films such as Cold Mountain (2003) and Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003), and then was cast in two villain roles: Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka The Scarecrow, in Batman Begins (2005) and Jackson Rippner in Red Eye (2005). Although slight in nature for a villain, Murphy's piercing blue eyes helped to create creepy performances and critics began to take notice. Manhola Dargis of the New York Times cited Murphy as a \"picture-perfect villain\", while David Denby of The New Yorker noted he was both \"seductive\" and \"sinister\".Later that year, Murphy starred as Patrick \"Kitten\" Braden, an Irish transgender woman in search of her mother in Neil Jordan's Breakfast on Pluto (2005), a film adaptation of the Pat McCabe novel. Although the film was not a box office success, Murphy was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical and he won Best Actor for the Irish Film and Television Academy Awards.The following year, Murphy starred in Ken Loach's The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006). The film was the most successful independent Irish film and won the Palm D'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Murphy continued to take roles in a number of independent films, and also reprised his role as the Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008). Nolan is known for working with actors in multiple films, and cast Murphy in Inception (2010) as Robert Fischer, the young heir of the multi-billion dollar empire, who was the target of DiCaprio's dream team. His most well-known work is starring as Thomas Shelby in the British TV show Peaky Blinders beginning in 2013.Murphy continues to appear in high-profile films such as In Time (2011), Red Lights (2012), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), the final film in Nolan's Batman trilogy.Murphy is married to Yvonne McGuinness, an artist.

He was the first-born child. His father was a\nRussian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to\nRussian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school\nwhere he participated in the drama club. After high school, he\ncontinued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan's progressive\nNew School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service\nin his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position\nas an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was\nhoning his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan\nand Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City\nallowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his\nexcellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and\ncoming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was\nnot until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was\nTennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\". After his Broadway success, he\nhad a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he\njoined the cast of\nOn the Waterfront (1954). In\nthe 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on\nsome of the most popular television series of that time, including\nThe United States Steel Hour (1953),\nThe Philco Television Playhouse (1948),\nGoodyear Playhouse (1951)\nand Studio One (1948). In 1957, he\nwas able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a\nprominent role in\n12 Angry Men (1957), directed by\nSidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin's television work\nin the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of\nAlfred Hitchcock Presents (1955),\nHitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key\nsupporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in\nPsycho (1960). His work with Hitchcock\nopened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong\nmovie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in\nBreakfast at Tiffany's (1961),\nCape Fear (1962) and\nThe Carpetbaggers (1964). One\nof the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy\nAward for Best Supporting Actor for\nA Thousand Clowns (1965). It\nwas soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He\nsoon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining\nyears. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life\ntraveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a\ncareer that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of\nnatural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a\nstroke at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was\nsurvived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe\nand Talia.",

It was no coincidence, that Binns would come to specialize in no-nonsense, hard-nosed detectives or guys in uniform, once his screen career took off in the mid-1950's. At the peak of his popularity, he starred in his own police series, Brenner (1959), which had a five-year run on CBS.Before Binns became a much sought-after general purpose actor, utilized in literally hundreds of early live television shows, his career suffered a serious setback: he was blacklisted during the House Un-american Activities Committee (Not Senator McCarthy) witch hunts as a suspected communist sympathizer. This turned out to be a case of mistaken identity (a Brooklyn alderwoman with the same surname -- not related -- had been a member of the Communist Party), but the blacklisting was not expunged for another two years. Another (lesser) source of disgruntlement for Binns was, that he found himself often mistaken for the actor Frank Lovejoy (though, arguably, he more closely resembled Charles Aidman!).In feature films, Binns was at his convincing best as the juror most likely to be swayed in 12 Angry Men (1957); as bomber pilot Colonel Grady in Fail Safe (1964); and as General Walter Bedell Smith in Patton (1970). He had numerous excellent TV credits to his name, including a recurring role as Al Mundy's boss on It Takes a Thief (1968) and as General Korshak, attempting to poach Hawkeye as his personal physician in M*A*S*H (1972). He was otherwise gainfully employed as a narrator, voicing commercials for Amtrak and United Way and, latterly, as a drama teacher. Ed Binns died of a heart attack, while being driven in his car on the way from Manhattan to his Connecticut home, on December 4 1990.",

He became interested in acting at the age of 24, when a director of England's National Theater Company, where he was studying, told him that acting was his special gift. In 1978, he moved to Tokyo to pursue acting. He drew the attention of the critics when Yukio Ninagawa, a famous Japanese director, chose him for the lead role in one of his plays, even though Ken was still an acting student. He made his first TV appearance in 1982. His big career breakthrough came when he was chosen to play the lead in the Japanese national TV drama series called \"Dokugan ryu Masamune\". He played a samurai leader hero, making him a household name in Japan. In 1989, he collapsed while filming a movie in Canada due to leukemia. He made a miraculous comeback & co-starred with Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai (2003), which pushed him to the center stage of Hollywood.Ken has a daughter, model, actress, & singer Anne Watanabe, & a son.
