The change of POV, the off camera kills slowly dwindling away until everything in its practical effects glory is displayed with a refusal to turn the camera from anything, and the (in a good way) head scratching ending.This review isn't to gatekeep this film, it's just to let people know who the intended audience is. I've seen many films where I wasn't the intended audience and the point of the film was lost on me. The early review to this film were very negative so I was bracing for a bad time but was surprised. This is one of those rare love letters to the genre that really requires additional watching of at least the classics to see what the director was going for. Otherwise it's just going to seem like senseless kills and walking around with no substance, where the true substance lies in the established features of the genre itself that it puts its twist on.Overall a fun time with some genuinely great moments and a must watch for slasher fans.",

Immersive and beautiful cinematography throughout. Nothing to over think or criticize. It's just a fun and new perspective of a classic tale.The lack of music made the soundscape ultra realistic. If you enjoy movies with light (but necessary) dialogue and context clues being left for you the viewer then you will definitely enjoy this new take on a tired genre. The kill scenes were absolutely incredible and often hard to watch till the end. Really great practical effects.Go support the smaller movies with new ideas so the studios will allow more to be made for us!",

            "text": "My wife and I saw In a Violent Nature (2024) at a screening at Alamo Drafthouse last night. The storyline follows a spirit that is awoken by some local campers, and they soon discover that this spirit has 60 years of pent-up anger, which they are about to experience firsthand.This film is written and directed by Chris Nash (ABCs of Death 2 segment), in his directorial debut, and stars Ry Barrett (Cult Hero), Andrea Pavlovic (Learn to Swim), Cameron Love (An Unexpected Killer) and Sam Roulston (Mood).I'll start by saying I wanted to like this movie much more. This is a very unique slasher in terms of its filming, storytelling, and overall cinematography. The horror elements are top-notch, featuring some of the best kill scenes I've seen in 2024. The unique kills and elite gore are absolutely awesome. Unfortunately, the story itself is extremely stale. There are excessively long sequences of walking or running through the woods with nothing happening. While this gives a realistic feel to how a real serial killer might operate, and their victims, the camper elements are purposely clichéd and cheesy, with bad lines and terrible acting. This intentional bad dialogue doesn't fit the killer's narrative. The campfire narration of the backstory is especially awful. On the other hand, I loved the killer, his backstory, and his presentation. This movie could have been much better with improved editing, a better cast, and a slightly bigger budget.In conclusion, In a Violent Nature is a unique and entertaining addition to the horror genre that falls short of its potential, but I'd definitely watch a sequel. I would score this a 6/10 and strongly recommend it.",

I very rarely see movies in theaters but this one I just had to see asap because I'm an indie horror fiend and I love supporting low budget horror films in theaters.The film follows the unsettled soul of Johnny, a now deranged killer that was put to rest years ago after an accident happened in town. Now, his soul is unsettled and after his grave is tampered with, he is resurrected to wreak carnage upon any and all as he seeks to retrieve his locket that was taken from his grave. Oddly though, the locket is what kept him in the ground so why would he be looking for it? You'd think it's something that is used against him as a weapon. The only weapon that can hurt him.There is literally zero depth to this movie. Johnny stalks his victims one at a time unleashing bloody kills upon them and that's it. Yes it is a reminder of what true slasher films are made of but it's like, a little too late to be a big triumph. This movie was made 4 years ago and is just getting a release. I think this is a better time for its release but it still lacks an identity to call its own. We get camera angles from over the killers shoulder but we equally get traditional camera shots so it's almost like the movie is unsure of its direction and style. It's artsy but not artsy enough. The shots are so run of the mill. We can hear the vapid dialogue between characters even when Johnny is a quarter mile away. This is because the movie closely follows the killer as he is in the spotlight but we still need to hear the story lines and the banter between the unsuspecting victims. It's weird and I haven't seen it really before but it's the only way we can actually hear any talking because Johnny doesn't talk. You'd think we hear the convos as Johnny gets closer but no, we hear them loud and clear from very far away. It's almost like putting a soundtrack in a found footage film that wasn't supposed to be fictionally edited.The kills are good. The beginning is slow and boring as is the entire movie for that matter but it still speaks to me because of the design and locations of the movie. The silence of the deep wood. The crickets and birds chirping and the unforgiving nature of our killer. This movie reminds me of another Ry Barrett movie, \"The Demolisher\". Which is maybe a slightly better movie overall.I liked it, You probably won't.",

The kills promised creative kills which there was a couple good ones but even then it left me wanting something of higher energy or something that produces a fear response as a minimum. I don't regret watching it but I won't revisit it any time soon. If I could add some ambient score or anything to add something other than rhythmic footsteps and make me care for a character to hope to survive, those would also be a plus. It was a well crafted film otherwise for a debut. I certainly couldn't make it look that good. Practical effects were great but believe it or not the gore was lacking for what the movie was marketed for.",

In a violent nature does not deserve to be this good yet the filmmakers loved and respect the genre enough to make it so.Coming at you mostly from the perception of the slasher himself, In A Violent Nature is in the essence of those 80s slasher films but there is a particular mastery of the camera movements that gives the film a certain depth that I was not expecting.Although, I must admit the filmmakers did get full of themselves at some point. This film had some brutal and gory death scenes. While one in particular was the crème de la crème of mutualization the film also has one huge miss because it felt like they tried too hard with it.But, overall, this was not different that your architype slasher movie but it was made differently than anything I've seen before and that's what makes it the quintessential watch for all horror fans.",

The dialogue is limited and typical teens in a cabin drama, but not overdone. The whole point is about the guy killing for no reason. It's very well shot and the special effects are amazing, no obvious CGI from what I could tell.Yes, the kill scenes are creatively brutal and worth all the walking/stalking that happens. I recommend seeing it in the theater if you can because it absolutely enhances the experience. Plus everyone in the audience audibly reacts to the gore together.

It also will fulfill gorehounds on the violent scenes, giving a lot seemingly homtage to Friday the 13th Jason character.Also exploring the Final Girl mythological definition.

And it's a whole lot of walking around the woods.This movie is a cool concept that sounds interesting on paper, but does not translate to screen. There is a complete lack of tension to the whole film. I think this is partially the way it's shot, but also because most (not all) of the time, we know where the killer is. The lack of music is also a detriment.The killer is not interesting like a Jason or Freddy. And we don't get a chance to know the victims either because we are too busy watching the killer walk around in the forest. It makes for an experience I had nothing to attach myself to, and no one to root for.The ADR is extremely distracting, and the performances and dialogue are not good. While I commend the movie for being excessively gory, and using all practical effects, I felt like I was watching aged effects. The dead bodies don't look real, and when thrown around they look very bad. I probably normally wouldn't care about this if I was locked into the movie, but I unfortunately was not.I appreciate it for trying something new. But sometimes things are done a certain way for a reason. In this case, slashers should follow dumb teenagers, and not the silent killers. They are way more fun to watch.",

            "text": "\"In a Violent Nature\" emerges as a visceral tour de force in the realm of slasher horror, a genre that often revels in its own excess. Director Chris Nash's homage to the low-budget '80s slashers is both a nod to the past and a savage reimagining for the modern era. The film's narrative, while not groundbreaking, serves as a sturdy scaffold for the true star of the show: the kills. The undead protagonist, Johnny, is a relentless force, his origin story rooted in a tragic mishap that sees him resurrected with a singular, vengeful purpose. The practical effects are a standout, with each kill executed with a level of gore and creativity that pushes the boundaries of the genre. The use of traditional tools of death, such as a hatchet and drag hooks, lends a brutal authenticity to Johnny's rampage. The cinematography is deliberate, with lingering shots that build tension and a camera that stalks its prey with the same predatory focus as Johnny himself. The film's pacing is unyielding, each scene meticulously crafted to escalate the horror until it reaches a crescendo of blood and terror. The performances are commendable, particularly given the film's modest budget. The rest of the cast are forgettable and don't trust them one bit, remember you're here for the gruesome kills not for other characters, Johnny is your main focus.\"In a Violent Nature\" is not just a slasher film; it's a statement. It's a bloody, unapologetic celebration of the genre that understands its roots and is not afraid to hack its way through the underbrush to carve out its own legacy. With its unflinching approach to horror and a killer who could very well become the next icon of terror.",

It's more \"artsy\" in the way it's filmed. Storyline is simple and understandable, but again simple at best. No character development. Again, you're following the killer, not the victims. I can see where an average person won't see the film for what it is, but it's unique in the sense that it's not your average slasher film. It's dull and slow at times, and the moments that it gets intense, it gets very intense. This is almost an one of a kind slasher flick. It's a slow burn but they ramp it up when the intensity is high. Go into it knowing it's not super cinematic. Not a detailed storyline. You're following a crazed killer with no reason or quality of life. Again, it's not for everyone but for a random off beat horror movie that is extreme on the violence, it's an interesting watch. Not a masterpiece by any means, but a different interesting take on the genre that if you're a horror cinema fan, you can get behind if you have the patience.

In fact, that actually might be why it's as great as it is. From the gory kills to the way Johnny hunts to the practicals and the sometimes suffocating silence, it's all there. The writing and acting could have used a bit more skill and tact, but if you go in strictly to see a monstrosity of a human absolutely butcher people then you're in for a treat.\"While I normally start with the good, let's get the bad out of the way\"The writing for In a Violent Nature does not do it any favors. Too much hand holding with the exposition, and dialogue that feels tacky, even for a slasher paying tribute to classic slashers. That said, it makes you eager for the kills, with characters being as annoying as they are. The pacing is slow, but given that it's from the perspective of the killer, that's expected. The big surprise here is how it plays with viewer expectations. I can't go into detail regarding this, but even as a devout slasher fan I was still surprised at how some key scenes unfolded...... The only noteworthy performance is Ry Barrett, who absolutely slays as the hulking and predatory Johnny; his performance as the killer oozes sinister and homicidal energy. Everyone else needed to dial down their performances, with facial expressions that go to extremes, and line delivery that doesn't land right. It almost feels intentional though, especially with how much it makes you want Johnny to just murder everyone.Visuals are the best kind of tense and ominous. Most of the film follows Johnny, with a few instances where the camera separates to go unpredicted routes. Johnny is surprisingly agile, and the kills are deliciously gruesome, with great brutal deaths. The cinematography is also exceptional, and the 1:1 ratio gives this intense claustrophobia that fits the remote setting. Camera placement is tactical and fully intentional, building scenes up as everything plays out. Practicals are great, whether it's the absolute ton of gore or just how characters look, it's all done right. Plus the natural lighting and how it plays into each scene is a stroke of genius in and of itself, though slightly underutilized...... There's intentional lack of composed music, which actually makes scenes more tense as it removes some of the usual ominous foreshadowing and replaces it with deliberate ambiguity. The sound effects are intentionally punched up, leaving the viewer on edge as Johnny stalks unsuspecting victims. There's still a soundtrack of sorts, but it's mostly music that plays in the background, as an added sound detail.Suffice it to say, In a Violent Nature is a good slasher flick with good kills and a great killer. The flaws aren't dealbreakers. It's definitely meant to be watched on a big screen, and you'll definitely enjoy it more in a theater setting than you would if you watch it when it releases on Shudder.... Adios....",

Like The Witch full frame works visually in the woods for my taste. I like seeing the tall tree tops in frame, it places me in the setting. I also enjoyed the sound design. The lack of music telling me how to feel or make me jump was refreshing. Other than those things, I find following the undead through the woods with the same over the shoulder shot very tedious. That and not getting to spend much time with any victim makes their deaths less thrilling. I actually yawned during a long drawn out scene involving a log splitter. Yes we do get to witness some good kills. Any slasher fan knows that's a big part of what makes an exciting slasher movie. A slasher isn't suppose to be a pure art film so I'm not judging it as that, nor would I judge a drama by comedy standards. Saying that any movie should have some artistic merit. As a slasher I will give it a 6 for the fact they made some nice touches with framing, sound, and delivering a couple gory kills. I believe the film maker had a vision and executed it fairly well, I'm just not sure it really works. Only the end section when we finally switch perspectives to the final girl does any tension build. It's not the worst or best slasher movie, it's different. Being different doesn't save it from being a bit of a tedious watch that doesn't fully pay off for me.",

I really enjoyed this aspect of the film, although it did come at the expense of the fear since I couldn't have cared less about any of the people doomed to die.The supernatural elements of the plot are purposefully left vague, but even so I felt it clash pretty clunkilly against the themes of the killer as a wild animal. It was just an element that didn't work very well for me.I found the final scene of the movie very frustrating. It felt like a departure from the whole rest of the story, and I felt frustrated by the end of it. In retrospect, I think it was probably a deliberate attempt to build tension and leave the viewer on a cliffhanger, but I didn't find it a very satisfying watch.All in all, I'm glad I saw this movie as there's really a lot to admire about the quality of the filmmaking. I don't think it completely worked in pulling off the different angles it was aiming for; I wouldn't necessarily watch it again but I would definitely go see the sequel.",

            "text": "Horror is my favorite genre. I saw TERRIFIER 2 twice in theaters. When I first saw the trailer for this film with its evocative title, I had high hopes for it... but also suspected that it could be pretty boring. The trailer itself is pretty boring. A slasher film that stays in the perspective of a lumbering monster has never been done before, so perhaps it could make audiences feel dread in a whole new way. I praise the idea of the experiment, but I also think it failed to set proper controls. Either way, the end result is incredibly boring.What the trailer suggests is real-time mayhem. It even hints at the possibility of a single take. The movie isn't really either of those things, and this is the most significant reason why the experiment fails. From the very beginning, there are artificial cuts; we don't just follow the killer as he walks up upon his first victim--rather, there's some editing that advances the pace along. What would be a 90-second walk down a driveway instead becomes a 75-second walk because of a couple of quick time elapsing cuts. Why bother? A 90-second take could be tedious, but it would also be immersive. A 75-second edit can only be tedious since your eyes and imagination are literally jarred out of being placed in the scene. The whole film is like this: writer/director Chris Nash wants us to feel immersed in the killer's movements but isn't daring enough with his editing to do full immersion. There's a reason why films like JEANNE DIELMAN (201 min.) and AN ELEPHANT SITTING STILL (234 min.) with their long, static, unedited shots feel \"shorter\" than this movie (94 min.): they commit to fully placing us in the unblinking perspectives of their characters. Our gaze fixates, our pupils expand, and our attention holds and absorbs with long takes, whereas edits inevitably lead to \"saccades\"--our eyes jolt to the change and our attention span reloads to take in the new sight. (Don't believe me? Search for \"Motion Pictures and Saccade Patterns,\" an excellent video about audience eye movements during THERE WILL BE BLOOD.) In short, the very editing that was presumably done to make the scenes briefer and less tedious probably only served to make them more uninteresting, not less.On top of that, most of the killings aren't even done in a single take. Some of them are, and those are the most effective scenes of horror in the film, but many of the slashings are hindered by jump cuts, deliberately obscured blocking, and off-camera action that only call attention to the film's limited special effects budget. A real-time, unflinching depiction of a murder is a terribly unsettling thing--see IRREVERSIBLE, DANCER IN THE DARK, and DEKALOG: FIVE for some particularly disturbing examples. A movie that just edits together different angles of a murder is simply standard slasher fare and not especially capable of terrifying. That's how most of this movie is, which is another reason why it's a failed experiment.If Nash had made this movie without all the unnecessary editing, it would have been a more successful experiment but it could've possibly been just as boring of a failure. Most of the acting is quite bad (in part because of the bad writing, which could have been avoided through some more naturalistic improvisation), the backstory is confusing and cliche, and there's nothing on display here that stands out as any indication of excellence--but at least we'd have a more accurate depiction of what appears to be promised by the trailer. I can't recommend this film to anyone--not even horror aficionados--who are likely to feel that their time has been wasted. At one point in the middle of the film, my husband went to the bathroom. When he returned, I filled him in on what he'd missed with a whisper: \"He did some walking.\" We laughed in our shared misery. Perhaps it's possible to make an effective horror movie in this style, but IN A VIOLENT NATURE is certainly not it.",

Think of that scene in Monte Python and the Holy Grail where they replay the same scene of a knight running towards you over and over.There were some original kills (credit where credit is due, the overlook kill was fantastic) but to see other reviews saying that it's horrifying, and the most frightening, gory film they've seen makes me question how much horror the reviewers have actually seen.It's a more ambient Friday the 13th / Jason film and nothing more.Walking out of the theater, I passed a man who turned to his wife and said, \"Well, we'll never get that time back\" and he's absolutely right.",

This undead dude named Johnny, resurrected by meddling campers, is on a bloody quest to reclaim a mysterious locket.Simple enough, I'm in.The first act is promising. The cinematography is cool, with a voyeuristic perspective that places you right in Johnny's rotting shoes (or lack thereof). Some of kills are undeniably brutal, with a focus on practical effects that'll make you squirm. It feels almost like a first-person video game at times, and for a horror fan, that's an initial thrill.But here's where things get messy. The novelty of Johnny's perspective wears off fast. The movie becomes repetitive. We see him lumber through the woods (this is where I wished I could mash the sprint button on my controller to get him to move quicker - so much walking), fixate on the teens through the trees, then unleash another gruesome kill.The campers themselves are forgettable slasher fodder. We don't care about them, and there's no attempt to make them interesting. They're just there to be gruesome set pieces.Then comes the ending. Let's just say it's a massive letdown. The build-up to the climax fizzles out with a whimper, leaving you feeling cheated after a slog through repetitive sequences. I honestly don't know if I would seek this out to watch again, but may possibly leave it on, if I came across it while it was playing.The gorehounds will find plenty to appreciate.

The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures.

Unfortunately, a lot of innocent people have to pay for that madness in the meanwhile, and that truly adds to the intensity of his madness as it increases and his vileness just gets more and more out of control.On the other end of the spectrum is Liam Neeson's Oscar Schindler, a businessman who knows by allowing the Nazis to take his Jewish workers away, his productivity will suffer. Selfish motives keep these innocent people from being sent to the death camps, and as Schindler learns the truth about the atrocities going on and becomes closer to the people who work very hard for him, he goes out of his way to keep the Nazis from going through with their evil plans.The atrocities you see here are things we can't fathom here in America. Innocent children are forced to hide in human waste to avoid discovery. An innocent woman prisoner with a background in architecture is brutally murdered after insisting that a building being constructed is doomed to collapse, after which the evil Fiennes simply orders his men to do what she suggested. Fiennes picks targets and guns them down, and also has Schindler's aged workers killed simply because he considers them too old to contribute. An innocent young girl in a red coat (the only color in this black and white movie) wanders around Warsaw as the ghetto is destroyed. Neeson almost looses his right-hand man (a magnificent Ben Kingsley) because of a paperwork mix-up. This culminates in the most daring of escapes from Nazi persecution, and that is where Neeson realizes the full effect of what's going on, breaking down in a scene that will have you shivering in your seat.I can't watch these movies without the temptation to scream at the Nazis on screen. Even in the most outlandish propaganda films of the war era, I tended to either applaud loudly or scream in delight \"Die, Nazi, Die!\" as the villain gets their come-uppance, either through brutal murder or the firing squad after a lengthy trial revealed their shame. Many of those times, my body was shaking so violently as sobs emerged from me that I was unaware I was capable of. You can't call these feelings manipulation by the direction; Spielberg obviously felt a passion for the story he was telling, as if he knows that this can cross over into any race, any culture, any religion.Rarely in recent movie history has it been so obvious when a film was released that it would sweep the Academy Awards, and \"Schindler's List\" truly deserved every honor which it received. Some stories are so painful that you can't go back and watch them easily; I find that every so often, I need a movie like \"Schindler's List\" to remind me of how vile humanity can be, and how one compassionate human being can change the course of history for so many. The finale with real-life \"Schindler Jews\" honoring their hero is truly awe inspiring and is certainly what you can call triumph over tragedy.",

As Saul Bellow said, \"Oppressed people tend to be witty.\" Pogroms didn't start with Hitler; by the time the Spanish Inquisition burned a hundred thousand Jews, the story of Jewish oppression already could fill many volumes. Many peoples once multitudinous have perished from the earth: there are no Carthaginians left. There are no more Thracians to speak of. The Celts live only in musical traditions and some old literature, having been subsumed by their conquerors. Their gods are dead, and their languages, or nearly so. But the Jews thrive on. Something kept hope alive under Stalin, under Isabella, under the Caesars. A sense of humor is a great virtue, not to be undervalued.But in order to make sure I appreciate the horror of the events portrayed, this movie cheats me of a glimpse at real life. The situations don't live as they might, because all the time I'm being flogged with message. There is no even partially redeemable Nazi in this movie, and Schindler's own late-stage change of heart is presented with such suddenness that the movie veers into melodrama. And even melodrama need not be propaganda; Minnelli and Ray always left us with choices. But \"Schindler\" must be classified as propaganda because it lacks the truth of even gallows humor, which by many reports existed in great abundance in the ghettos and even in the death camps.The films of Bunuel and Altman are often political but rarely propagandist. The films of Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel are always propagandist and not always political, though they are of course always bad. So propaganda need not be political, and politics need not be propaganda. This shouldn't need saying, but in the modern age of American politics, it's worth remembering. I wish Steven Spielberg remembered it. One can define propaganda objectively as a sort of forced perspective, a narrow range of potential reactions for the viewer. Propaganda is the use of art to persuade. It turns art into an expository essay. Propaganda is therefore by definition a limited form, limited by its very agenda. The tools of propaganda become less necessary the more inherently obvious the subject matter; the mass extermination of a people would seem to me to fit this category. So I think the style of this movie is unfortunately maudlin, an overkill on the negative. I am not heartless; I hate hate as much as anybody, and I celebrate Jews and all humans as valuable and not for burning. But is there no other way to express a political point than to make me cry for three hours? The fact is that film as a medium lends itself to propaganda. There is a decision made about every angle; literally, the perspective is chosen for the viewer. This is not the case with other arts, with musical performance, acting, writing, sculpture; but the more visual the medium, the greater its tendency to make statements and the less its potential for ambiguity. It takes a lot of skill to manage a visual art form into something with real depth, into a question rather than an answer.You can make propaganda about love, like \"Love Story\" or \"English Patient\"; you can make propaganda out of character, like \"Patton\" or \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" The easiest and most common sorts of propaganda are flag-waving and hate-mongering - what's found in state of the union addresses and election campaign ads. At its best, propaganda can remind us of our values, of our responsibilities, of our mythologies and potentials; and so it can be a great good. At its worst, propaganda may contain any of the faults of any medium - it may be bland, dull, predictable. When it is these things, it is not very persuasive, and so it fails at its main intent.In this light, \"Schindler's List\" is maybe the second-best type of propaganda. It has real emotion, a compelling story, myriad technical virtues; it leaves me with no choice but to agree with it, but of course I agree with it already insofar as genocide is not a force for good. The movie moves me to an extent. But it lacks comedy, the propagandist's most effective tool; and so when it pretends to explore a range of humanity, it tells a half-truth. Liam Neeson plays an excellent cad, and Ralph Fiennes' raptor beak was never used to more terrifying effect. (It is among the many faults of the \"Harry Potter\" movies that they cut off his nose.) But I prefer \"The Pianist\" as a portrait of Nazi-occupied Poland. Aside from possessing greater artistic powers than Spielberg, Roman Polanski has an immensely deeper capacity for human truth. He does not preach, and he is not strident, and he is not sentimental. And he allows Adrien Brody to make me laugh occasionally, not as often as he makes me cry but sometimes. Shakespeare's trick of contrasting tragedy with comedy is not simply effective storytelling; it is a view to a more realized universe. \"Jaws\" has it. \"E.T.\" has it. But Spielberg apparently felt that to be funny about the Holocaust would be in bad taste. As far as propagandist filmmakers go, I'll take Charlie Chaplin or Paul Verhoeven. They are at least funny; the pill of \"Great Dictator\" or \"Starship Troopers\" goes down more easily, more persuasively, therefore more effectively, than the pill of \"Schindler\" or \"Private Ryan.\"",

            "text": "Schindler's List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being \"deeply moved\" or \"touched.\"Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?And what about Amon Göth, the representative Nazi? A \"grotesque caricature\" if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why Göth hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.The attempt to add depth to Göth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's \"banality of evil\". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.Another peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out \"I could have saved one more\", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see:* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...Like most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child.Stick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making children's films. You're out of your depth.",

            "text": "You might not have heard about Oscar Schindler but you will definitely want to know more about him after watching the movie. He is credited with saving the lives of more than a thousand Jews during the Holocaust. He was named Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli Government a few years after the end of the Second World War. Righteous among the Nations is awarded to those non-Jews who helped Jews during the Holocaust in various ways such as providing them food or shelter, arranging escape out of Germany and German- occupied territories, etc.Schindler's List is based on a 1983 novel, Schindler's Ark. It tells the story of the efforts of Oscar Schindler, a German, to help Jews during the Holocaust. Played by Liam Neeson, Oscar is not an easy character to comprehend. It takes you time to fully understand who he is. He is a person who might come across selfish to you at first. He is an opportunistic businessman. He comes across as one who, even during the wartime, is trying to find opportunities to make money rather than worrying about people's lives. But deep inside, he has a heart bigger than the most and at a time when Jews were struggling to find a helping hand, he helped more than a thousand Jews. He is not a person who will give you sympathy for you are going to lose someone close, but he is one who would take actions to save your closed one and not tell you when he does. You can see this in the movie when a Jewish lady approaches him begging to get her parents out of the concentration camp and into his factory. At first, he not only denies her help but also lashes out at his assistant showing frustration how his for-profit factory has come to be known to people outside as a charitable harbor for Jews. But you can hear the pain he feels for that lady and all the other Jews in his frustrated voice. Later in the scene, the lady's parents are shown being escorted out of the concentration camp into his factory.The movie starts with how Oscar Schindler, in the midst of the Second World War, sets up a factory manufacturing pots and pans to supply to the German army. Oscar hires a Jewish accountant to manage the factory. While the account runs the factory enormously profitably for Schindler, he hires many Jews who would have otherwise ended up in concentration camps. By getting German SS guards to believe that they have the important skill sets required for the factory, he cleverly sneaks many Jews out of the concentration camps.As Oscar is setting up his factory, the German SS is brutally evicting all the Jews out of their houses and moving them to ghettos and later to labor camps. As Oscar and his wife helplessly watch eviction of a ghetto from a hill overlooking it, he realizes the dreadfulness of the war and that he needs to look beyond the factory profits and help the Jews. The atrocities that the Jews face will touch your heart. In a scene of a labor camp, as little children are being taken away by German SS guards from their mothers, a child runs away to hide. He tries a few places including outhouses but finding them occupied by other children, he dives through a toilet seat in a toilet pit to hide. The fear of life on the face of the little child as he settles in the toilet pit will bleed your heart.As the war progresses, the state of the Jews worsens. The SS plans to exterminate all the Jews and hence gradually starts moving them from labor camps to concentration camps. Oscar's pots and pans factory are not considered important enough for the war effort to continue employing the Jews anymore but he is determined to keep the Jews in his factory, by now called Schindler Jews, from the concentration camps as he devises a new plan.Despite the dark and sad story-line, the movie has many snippets of humour. As Oscar's manager is cleverly hiring Jews in the factory by keeping the SS in dark, he also hires an old man without a left arm as a metal polisher. The state of the old man is sad and the act of the manager is kind. But the subtle humour in the situation is difficult to miss when Oscar comes to know about the old man and frustratingly asks his manager how the old man is useful for the factory.Overall, Schindler's list is a heart-touching and a powerful movie that will force even a cold heart to warm for a moment. The movie is engaging and will keep you engaged for the entire three hours. It is a must-watch. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10.",

Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget.",

            "text": "This movie is visually stunning. Just the sheer mass of extras, set design, costumes, cinematography, and everything else that went into this movie is breathtaking. Through all this, the movie definitely pulls off a war-time atmosphere, the black & white photography only adds another element to this. The acting is (mostly) great. And the story is a good one and an important one. What Schindler did deserves our recognition, respect, and reverence. I'm glad Spielberg was able to bring it to our attention.Now for the problems with this movie. First off, the length: I think this movie's 3 hour 15 minute runtime just snuck by Gandhi as the longest theatrically released movie in my viewing history. I try not to make a fuss over the length of a movie; however long the director requires to get their story across to the audience is up to them. What I do take issue with is a movie that has a 3+ hour long runtime that is completely unnecessary such as this one. This movie contains a story that doesn't need its allotted time. I think a 200 minute cut of this movie would really improve it, maybe even a straight 2 hours if you're pushing it. Too much time is taken replaying the horrors of Nazi-occupied Germany seemingly over and over again. I just want to be clear that I am not trying to diminish what happened or the emotional impact these scenes have, however when we as an audience are bombarded with scene after scene of tyrannical cruelty via the hands of the Germans, the emotional effectiveness of said scenes starts to fall under the law of diminishing returns. At a certain point, I as an audience member have no emotional energy left to invest and the effort Spielberg's putting into causing a mournful tone just becomes fruitless. With most things in life, overexposure will lead to dulling of the senses and emotional desensitization. I am aware that what is occurring on- screen is horrendous but my mind can no longer keep up with what is being presented. Sometimes less is more.My next issue relates to the treatment of the protagonists and antagonists of this movie. No, there is no excuse for what the Nazis did and defending this party or their belief system is contemptible and disturbing. But as a director making an Oscar-winning Best Picture, please do not make your characters these black and white symbols of good and evil. Not every person in the Nazi regime was 100% certifiably evil; not every person representing the good guys was a sinless angel. It is up to you as a director to show us these characters, their nuances, their grey areas, and their stories as a whole. It is up to us as an audience to take in all of this and make decisions about these stories and their characters. But when a director paints all these characters in broad strokes, labeling everyone as either entirely pure or entirely evil, he or she has taken the decision out of our hands and we as an audience are forced to consume the subject matter from the pre-destined moralistic vantage point that the director has prepared for us. That is exactly what has happened here. Spielberg hold our hand through the entirety of this movie, not leaving anything up to the audience's interpretation or judgment. In Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist\", we get to see the multiple dimensions to characters from this conflict. Polanski focuses more on the character development of the Nazis and Jews and less on the abhorrent crimes that were occurring. So, when we do see some kind of appalling act taking place on the screen, it is considerably more effect and haunting. But the point is that Polanski treats all characters, whether bad or good, like human beings. And, to me at least, it is much more frightening to see people with humanlike qualities behind these egregious acts of genocide. (See \"Downfall\" for another great example.) Spielberg's Nazis act more like monsters from some other dimension, far less unsettling. Another issue I see with this movie is the character arc of our main focus, Oskar Schindler himself. At the beginning of this movie, we see a man who can be labeled as a womanizer, a drunkard, an opportunist, and someone who is self-centered and focused on personal wealth attainment. By the end of the movie we see a family man melodramatically balling his eyes out because he didn't give away enough of his wealth to save more Jews. (Did we really need that scene?) In theory this is a nice beginning and end point, however during the movie itself, we do not see exactly how this man went from being an egoist to a full-fledged humanitarian. Sure, the scenes involving the young girl with the red coat is supposed to represent a pair of epiphanies that Schindler has that alters his mindset similar to a Dickensian Scrooge. However, to me at least, these two scene do not do enough to cause me to buy this change. This movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes. We could spend a little of that time seeing Schindler's subtle changes over the course of the war. Instead we have this dramatic shift seemingly overnight that is difficult to swallow for me as an audience member. The character development just comes across as half-baked.Despite all the gripes I have with this film, I still think Spielberg made a fine movie here. He told a beautiful story competently and with a few scenes that left me awe-struck. While the length of this film is a bit overwhelming, it is still something that I think everyone should see at least once, a very important piece of film history.",

Unsurprisingly, given Ritchie's involvement, liberties have been taken with the story.The SOE existed to operate behind enemy lines, committing sabotage and various other acts considered ungentlemanly by the upper crust officers who ran the conventional army. In 1942, England was starving and its army could not be resupplied because German U-boats owned the seas. With the blessing of Winston Churchill, the commander of the SOE sent a team to destroy the Duchessa d'Aosta, a supply ship that supplied all the carbon dioxide filters for the U-boats. These filters permitted these submarines to remain submerged for prolonged periods. By disabling the supply ship, the U-boat fleet would be effectively sidelined. The mission was labelled Operation Postmaster. It took place in January, 1942. This story centers on the real characters - Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), Anders Larssen (Alan Ritchson) and Geoffrey Appleyard (Alex Pettyfer) - who were sent to complete this mission. In this film, some totally fictitious characters and other amalgamations of real-life participants also tagged along.\"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" contains all the satisfying flourishes of a film by Guy Ritchie (\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,\" \"Sherlock Holmes,\" \"The Gentlemen\"). This film is cool and stylish. It's filled with swaggering characters spouting cheeky dialogue. There are flashbacks to keep the moviegoer off-balance. There are first-rate set pieces/action scenes. Oh, and there's violence - lots and lots of violence, most of it gratuitous. Did I mention the violence? The entire package is delivered with a manic gleefulness that's contagious.While the story is \"based on true events,\" reality is just a jumping off point. This film suggests that a major role of the operation was to persuade an officially neutral US to enter the war and begin helping Britain. Pearl Harbor occurred the month before, so the US was already fully engaged. The film also suggests that by disabling the supply ship, the SOE's mission could change the course of the war. While the events depicted in \"Ungentlemanly Warfare\" were not unimportant, a bigger factor was the development of RDX, an explosive powerful enough to sink the U-boats in the open sea.The film offers an interesting side note. One of the staffers for the SOE depicted in the film is a young officer named Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox). Yep, that Ian Fleming. His boss was known as M. In his James Bond novels, Fleming incorporates the character of M. Fleming has noted several times that the character of James Bond was based on Gus March-Phillips.To summarize, the cast here is charming and appealing, in no small part because they appear to be reveling in their madcap roles. Some of the location shots (much of the movie was filmed in Antalya, Turkey) make the film as worthwhile as a NatGeo documentary. The \"true story\" is a muddled mess. And there's the violence, lots and lots of violence. (Historical note: no one was actually killed during Operation Postmaster, although one Nazi soldier fainted at the sight of the intruders.) Guy Ritchie's energy and enthusiasm, which permeate this piece, will win over a lot of the folks in the seats.",

There are a few scenes that felt very Tarantino-esque in its hyper violence or intensity, but likely couldn't be taken further because of the limitations of a true story. While not mad at the casting, they could've skipped on giving Alan Ritchson the crappy danish accent. And when Eiza Gonzalez's character's ethnicity is introduced, you'll probably raise an eyebrow considering she's a Mexican actress.",

The Blitz is destroying London. U-boats are cutting off the Atlantic supply route. America remains on the sidelines. The Nazis' main U-boat supply ship is located in a neutral Spanish colonial west African port. British parliament refuses to attack a neutral country. Winston Churchill secretly orders the unauthorized mission led by imprisoned soldier Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill) with his motley crew of outsiders.This is one of those real fake history movies. It's more than the normal fictionalization. It's got the wild sardonic Guy Ritchie humor. These characters are rather one dimensional with a few exceptions. It feels more like a comic book movie although that's fine since that's the intention. A highlight is the insanely gorgeous Eiza González. Alan Ritchson and his giant muscles seem to be popping up everywhere. I like this, but I don't love it.",

The story was largely unknown to the public until 2016 when documents from that era were declassified.The dramatized narrative does have its silly moments, as shown in the previews, but the story is nothing but. Had these brave men and women not completed the mission, there is a chance Hitler would have won the war.If you wish to see arrogant Nazis get shot, blown up, tortured, stabbed, or otherwise maimed, then definitely go see this movie. It was most satisfying to see as many of them hurt as possible. Even knowing that the Germans lost the war, I was on the edge of my seat during the covert action, but also laughing out loud while they perform said action.There are so many movies made about World War II that I was very pleasantly surprised to see one that I knew nothing about. I know this was intentional as the operation was classified. So many acts of bravery and heroism still continue to not see the light of day, and I cheered (along with the rest of the audience) at the conclusion.It's very much an R rated film, but this is one that everyone should see. So much could have gone wrong throughout the entire war that life today as we know it would be so different. Always remember that the war didn't just last 6 years, only direct combat. This had been going on for decades, and the lessons learned afterwards must still be repeated.",

            "text": "Cinemark has brought back its Secret Movie Series, and having never been to such an event before, I found myself intrigued and, for the low price of $5, I simply couldn't resist buying a ticket. I was one of six people in the theatre - clearly, a secret movie experience is a hard sell. However, I was excited at the prospect of watching something without knowing exactly what it would be. And after the trailers concluded, the lights dimmed and the film began to roll - to my delight, the secret movie was \"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.\"As a Guy Ritchie fan, after having seen the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it - although, admittedly, I didn't think the trailer was especially striking. However, I like Ritchie, and I love Cavill, so I was pleasantly surprised at the reveal of this film being the secret movie. And you know what? This is actually a pretty fun flick.Yes, there is nothing too innovative at play here - this is standard Ritchie fare, except more nuanced and less extreme in its directing and editing choices than, say, Ritchie's King Arthur film. \"Ministry\" plays out more like a typical action adventure movie with flares of Ritchie's signature style coming out here and there; and this more subdued approach actually works to the movie's advantage to highlight some of the more dramatic and intense moments. But if you're going to see this film, you're most likely going to see it due to the action that the trailer promised you. And how is the action? In a word: Great.My only complaint about the violence in this film - not to sound too bloodthirsty - is that it is surprisingly bloodless for an R-rated movie. I was really expecting something akin to Quentin Tarantino, with huge spurts of blood and gory deaths, but Ritchie, once again, takes a more subdued approach, choosing not to showcase a lot of blood or grisly images. That said, the action in this movie is still FANtastic, playing out an intensity that is simply missing from most modern action movies. There are plenty of shootouts - both with guns and with arrows; there are knife fights and axe battles; there are hand to hand combat sequences; basically, all of the WW2 action you can imagine is in this movie, and it's filmed wonderfully, without shaky camera or quick cuts. Sure, I would've preferred a bit more blood when Nazi's were punched or shot or sliced, but I can't knock Ritchie for choosing not to include that for the sole reason that the action is filmed so freaking well. It's nice to watch an action movie that has two things: 1) a lot of action and 2) clearly filmed action. Luckily, \"Ministry\" has both of those things, and because of that, will be sure to satisfy even the most jaded action junkie.In Ritchie films, both the plot and the actors are always standouts, and it's no different here in \"Ministry.\" Cavill and his band of ungentlemanly warriors are all super entertaining to watch, their chemistry leading to many laugh out loud moments. Additionally, the plot - as IMDB puts it, \"a small group of highly skilled soldiers strik(ing) against German forces behind enemy lines during World War II,\" offers a lot more meat to chew on than you might expect. There are a lot of things happening concurrently, which leads to storylines converging in a pretty satisfying way. There are also a few unexpected moments that force the plot to go in directions I didn't expect, but certainly enjoyed watching. The plot isn't anything phenomenal, but it kept me engaged and was a great vehicle for its characters and action.\"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\" is a good time at the theatre. This doesn't necessarily offer something that you haven't seen before, but in a genre as tired as WW2 action is, \"Ministry\" shakes things up just enough in terms of its colourful characters and explosive action that you can't help but have fun watching this. And if you're a fan of Guy Ritchie? Then going to see this is really a no brainer.",

If you like movies based on Historical events, that seem to also show the connection between new film franchises, and old, this is a pretty good film for that.You have Henry Cavill walking through the entire film, with zero sense of urgency. You have the poor man's Gal Gadot, who does nothing but act as eye candy and a distraction to both the on screen talent, and the audience. You have Alan Ritchson who more or less steals the entire film as the lunatic killing machine. Honestly everyone does a decent job but frankly you could have cast anyone in this movie and it would have turned out the same.I like some things I have seen by Guy Ritchie, but this movie is a little less interesting because everything is so bland and safe. Visually, it's okay. It's not great. There were some good moments in the movie and some funny things that happen, but you can see where the moment lingers and the tension is not there at all. That's the thing. I did not feel one bit of tension for anyone at any time in this movie.That's the real sad part about this film, as you don't care about anyone before, during or after things get rolling. There's no air of menace to any of the bad guys, there's no chemistry between any of the characters.

No poor decision by the heroes can't be fixed by an even dumber action by the villains. It's the kind of thing a small child would do when setting their favorite toys against the bad toys.Sure, the explosions, smug lines and action are kind of cool, but eventually the lack of real suspense or story writing made the movie boring.

If the script made us care more about the people, this would have been great movie. Instead everyone comes off as \"movie characters;\" I'm sure the actual people involved were far more interesting than that. In some ways, the movie highlights a fascinating mission from WWII while doing a disservice to the men involved.Those script issues aside, the movie's direction and tone are very fun. There's a great musical sequence I very much enjoyed and I did find myself invested in the mission as the third act neared.

Much of it has to do with the direction, I'm afraid. A lack of spirit and inspiration can be felt throughout the film, sometimes worse than other times, but neither the shots he called nor his direction of the actors are worthy of Ritchie's potential. The script could have used a bit more polishing, especially concerning the dialogue, but it's really mostly the practical aspects where this falls flat.If you're a native German speaker, you will also notice how bad the fake Germans actually are. They should have been dubbed, but nobody seemed to care. Even Til Schweiger messed up some lines in German (probably drunk on set, as usual) - nobody cared.What also made the film worse than it could have been is the score. Someone told the composer to go for \"Schifrin meets Morricone\", I guess, and what he delivered was a weak attempt at copying both. No swing, no drama, no feeling whatsoever. Just flat and boring, matching the direction perfectly.That being said, you can still kill a bit of time watching this, since Cavill, Ritchson, et al are very likeable and have a lot of charming presence. Locations are nice, the DoP did a great job with the lighting, and Eiza González has a great singing performance (refreshingly with no audible pitch correction, but as a professional singer with an amazing voice she really doesn't need any), even though the arrangement and interpretation of the famous \"Mack The Knife\" is quite horrible.But if anything, this has made me wish for a more silly WW2 comedy with Cary Elwes in the lead.

'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' is based on fact and tells the story of Operation Postmaster - a secret mission - which was carried out in 1942. Many people lost their lives during this operation (which off course is exaggerated in the movie) and yet the film has a lighthearted narration which sees the soldiers cracking jokes whilst killing the enemy. This is indeed a very different approach but it allowed for a highly entertaining movie which is not to be taken too seriously, and that was funny and enjoyable instead of nail-biting suspense.I absolutely loved Henry Cavill here, in the role of Gus March-Phillips, who leads the operation. In fact, the entire cast was just brilliant and I also thoroughly enjoyed hunky Alan Ritchson as Anders Lassen. This character was so inventive when it came to killing people, he was an absolute delight to watch!So, Gus March-Phillips is recruited to lead Operation Postmaster - a mission to cut off supplies to the German submarines in Nazi-controlled waters. Gus selects his own team, which consists of Henry, Freddy, and Anders. On their way, they rescue Geoffrey from captivity, and include him in their team.Then there are agents Marjorie and Heron, who is sent to the island of Fernando Po, so Marjorie can get close to Nazi Commander Heinrich Luhr in order to get information from him.The film follows the team as they execute their daring and ambitious plans. With every obstacle, they have to devise a new and more daring plan, and it was a lot of fun to watch! There was a bit too much killing for my liking, but the action sequences are fantastic and in general the film is thoroughly entertaining. The cinematography is good, and the Oscar-worthy score is AWESOME!! This was one of the best film scores I've heard in a while.From an entertainment perspective, 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare' delivered!! The film's climax is action all the way!

However, I also like the movies not to be just a bunch of worn out tropes and cliches loosely stitched together without any sense, and this movie is exactly that.There is very little good about it, but plenty of bad. The script, although based on a true, and supposedly interesting, story, is horrible, making for an uninteresting and completely unbelievable viewing. The protagonists are basically an indestructible bunch of superheroes, that cannot be harmed by any means, and destroy enemies by merely looking at them. They loosely wave their weapons in the general direction of the enemies and the enemies all die, apparently killed by self guided smart bullets.The British government and military is supposedly full of traitors, defeatists and collaborationists, except for maybe two guys and the superhero team. Also, we are never given a satisfactory reason why they would be so vehemently opposed to the mission. Maybe because it was so \"ungentlemanly\" and the British are such gentlemen (if being a gentleman means stealing other nations' lands and resources and killing the native people, while saying \"sir\" and \"good morning\" in a very stuck up way).There is zero tension. Fake, \"insurmountable\" obstacles are introduced every couple of minutes, only to be resolved seconds later without any effort. By the time it happens for the second or third time, you don't care at all, because you know that it doesn't mean anything.There is no character development, no originality. Protagonists are the best at everything. The main villain has zero personality, zero originality, zero... anything. He is super evil, the end, and he basically does nothing for the whole movie, except existing in a very evil way.Alan Ritchson's character is supposed to be 22. Ritchson can't pass as a twenty-something by any stretch of imagination.The obligatory femme fatale is a paper thin stereotype, the best looking, the smartest, the coolest. She is also a crack shot that hits every target with the aiming technique that would not enable her to hit the side of a barn from two steps away. She is also supposed to be British-German-Jewish, but the actress is Mexican and looks it.The movie is also filled by meaningless scenes of empty and stupid dialogue that is supposed to sound deep and smart but instead just pads the run time. The action scenes, on the other hand, are too cartoonish to be taken seriously, and not funny enough to be considered comedy.I kept watching hoping that it would get better, but it stayed flat and boring until the end.",

            "text": "\"How Churchill's Secret Warriors Set Europe Ablaze and Gave Birth to Modern Black Ops.\" Damien Lewis (from subtitle of his book)Having matured as a filmgoer in the 60's, I loved the derring-do, guns-for-hire adventures like Dirty Dozen and Professionals. Now Guy Ritchie has renewed the genre with The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, a semi-fictional story wherein a group of mavericks is hired by British WWII leaders, including Churchill (Rory Kinnear), to neutralize the Nazi machine that produces U boats menacing Brits in the North Atlantic.Among the Brit officers is a young Ian Fleming (Freddie Fox), pre-James Bond-in fact, the lead maverick, Gus March-Phillips (Henry Cavill), may have been Fleming's model for Bond. The enterprise cannot be acknowledged by the Brits if the team is caught, and the Nazis would execute them. This based-on-a-true story is heroic by any definition.Ministry is an A movie for \"adventure\" and a B for badinage, making it a solid fit for summer escapism and a whiff of history. The subdued quips are Ritchie's renovation-fewer wise-guy asides and more unsubtle action. Henry Cavill nicely underplays the usually out-there leader such as Lee Marvin did. Much more bonhomie with Cavill.Ritchie also updates the genre by referring to Casablanca more than once. Good company. What he doesn't do is ratchet up the suspense, as in say Guns of Navarone. In fact, each encounter with the Nazis is too easy for the gang to navigate. Ritchie is relaxed with the conflict.Gus's cohorts are a mix of Dwayne Johnson and Steve McQueen types with a little Strother Martin on the side. Adding a sharpshooting femme fatale, Marjorie Stewart (Eiza Gonzalez), is a much-appreciated upgrade. She lends a sophisticated and deathly beauty, a danger for which the Nazis didn't quite account.Ritchie owes Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds in its setup and tone, although his execution is uneven: sometimes irreverent, sometimes grim. But, hey, it's almost summer and we're relaxing with a movie that does not claim to be historically accurate or artistically high. It's plain fun.",

The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word \"epic\" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10",

Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of \"Smeagol\" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for \"The Two Towers\" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to \"The Battle of Helms Deep\", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. \"Definitive\" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings \"The Two Towers\" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.",

A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.",

And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal.

While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor, Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam (Sean Astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master, particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery, and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in \"The Two Towers\"; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though, there was almost a comic element to it, whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film; I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The \"olyphants\" were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs, wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time, and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film, and repeated viewings are helpful, along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie, I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually, the books and the film complement each other nicely, even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that \"The Lord of the Rings\" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time, it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor, loyalty, friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.",

            "text": "The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",

In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring \"actors\" not \"stars\"; \"Oscar-worthy\" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down.

I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum.  Gollum gave an astonishing performance.  The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.  The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor.  Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor.  For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.\nOn the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.  I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening.  There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli, and Legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times.  Aragorn's performance is outstanding.  He has proven that he can be put on an A-List of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance.Gandalf \"the White\" in this film was a twist.  We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard.  Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking \"leaf\" as explained in the novel.  There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard.  No fireworks, or pipes.  Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.\nVery dark are the times for Frodo, and Samwise.  Gollum seams to give Frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well.  It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo, and our hero is slipping.  But the surprise was aimed at Samwise.  Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend.  Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment.  This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair.\nMerry and Pippin's story is very odd initially.  The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others.  The Ents were very well done CGI wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience.  They are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor.  Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them.This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.  I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent.  This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away.  There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10",

Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir, Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me, he probably is best know for his role as the captain in \"Titanic\" in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum/Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.I've never been really a big fan of the editing of \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.But \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.A spectacular adventure action experience.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "text": "As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema.",

            "text": "In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.",

It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.",

            "text": "After Fellowship, the world wondered if Peter Jackson could sustain the momentum. The Two Towers is the shortest segment and the story is split into parallel tales. More characters enter the story, including one of the most important. Can Jackson do it? Of course he can.Spoilers: Two Towers sustains the magic of Fellowship, while expanding the scope of the story. Gollum enters the picture, in full view not shadow, and is a triumph to behold.The story cuts back and forth between Merry and Pippin's encounter with Treebeard and the Ents; Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn and their attempts to locate the hobbits and free them; and Sam Frodo and Gollum as they move closer to Mordor. Each aspect is well covered, without losing track of the other story. Rohan provides the setting for the first great battle (aside from the prologue in Fellowship) and what a battle it is. Gandalf returns, much changed from his encounter with the balrog. The evil of Wormtongue appears, and Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer take the stage.There are many great moments, from the mounted battles to Gollum and Smeagol's dialogue, Legolas' surf archery to Theoden's cure. Helm's Deep is a spectacular segment that takes one back to the epic films of the past. Darkness looms for Frodo and Sam, as Frodo slips deeper under the spell of the ring. He finds new, and sometimes strange, allies; as well as new foes. His journey becomes more difficult with each step.The quality of the production continues. The Rohirrum are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost Anglo-Saxons. The battle scenes are engaging and terrifying. War is depicted with all of its consequences. Your heart is torn as you see the young separated from their parents, innocents are killed, and destruction abounds. At the same time, strength and hope come to those in desperate need and courage comes in the unlikeliest of moments. You find yourself in the lowest depths, as all seems lost; and then your heart soars, as hope comes at the last moment. This is storytelling at its finest.This is not a sequel, it is another chapter in an epic saga. As such, it builds on the previous chapter and advances the story. The pace quickens as the conflict rises. The stakes are higher and the danger greater. The audience is on the edge of their seat, as darkness looms, while the threads of hope begin to weave together. The stage is set for the final battle.",

Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.\nThe movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok.

The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

And, along the way, we meet one of the most interesting characters of this, or any movie: Gollum, the complex, torn, schitzophrenic slave to the will of the One Ring.And, even more than the first film, the Ring is also a character: the viewer can see it wearing down Frodo, pushing him to the limit, tempting those around him. The encounter at Osgiliath, while not in the book, is a fascinating visual realization of more subtle themes in the book.

His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby.

Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.",

A bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but Peter Jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised.spoilers followFor example; One does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. Anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. Historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. One also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. It is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine.There were other very badly handled scenes but I won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. It is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art SGI effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics).

It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you're sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I'm 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!",

I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do.

Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include \"Fantasia,\" \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" \"Casablanca,\" \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"North by Northwest,\" and \"The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as \"...the richest man in town.\" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.",

            "text": "I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the \"richest and meanest man in town\", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save. Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you. And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",

            "text": "This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.",

Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly.

You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.",

            "text": "It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers? Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently. Bethany Cox",

            "text": "Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert.America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Two reasons:1. Because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U. S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people.2. Because Capra proves himself right with his own movie. As an influential leader/filmmaker, he is skilled enough to make generations of sentimental Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us.",

I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure.

            "text": "Finally, at the age of 38, I saw \"It's A Wonderful Life\" in its entirety (after catching a few minutes here and there over the years on TV). When it was over, I found myself puzzled over why this movie is considered such a classic.I am not talking about the acting, or the film's technical proficiency. All of that seemed fine, even well-done at times. I am talking about its reason for being: Its story.I'll assume you have seen it, so prepare for spoilers. The basic message of this movie seems to be that a man who never left his home town to pursue his personal dreams nevertheless led a wonderful life due to his kindness and caring for the town and its residents. In fact, when he finally reaches a low point, the town's residents come to bail HIM out, thereby proving what a wonderful person he has been.A nice story, but the movie misses two logical points. First, was the man who never pursued his personal dreams (George Bailey) HAPPY with the life he DID lead? If he was happy with staying home, helping people afford houses and bailing out his family's business, then the point of the movie is MOOT. He evidently gave up very little for a happy life. Other than a few wistful asides, we never see that George is bothered much that he didn't travel the world. He seems perfectly content where he is. So if he is happy, then the central message of kindness and helping others while sacrificing your own dreams is weak or lost entirely.Second, if a man spends DECADES helping out residents of his little town (most of whom remain residents over the years), I don't see it as any great act of charity that when the man needs monetary help, all those people he assisted over the years are willing to give him a few dollars to fix his problem. The climactic ending, when people line up to give George 20 bucks here and 75 bucks there, is made to look like some kind of incredible holiday miracle. But think about it: If a man made it possible for YOU to buy your first home (in an era when buying a home was truly a dream), and a few years later he needs some money for his business (which is the entity that helps so many local people) to survive, wouldn't you go donate whatever you could afford to help him? It wouldn't even have to be that painful, really, in a town with several thousand residents.No, I think the town's true colors are shown earlier, when George's business almost goes under due to a run on the banks and his customers are more than happy to run to his competitor's bank to get 50 cents on a dollar. Some people end up staying ONLY after George uses his own WEDDING MONEY to pay them a fraction of what they sought to withdraw (which, when you think about it, is no real risk ... they can always go to the competitor later if things get worse). THAT seemed to me to also be normal behavior by the local residents, and it was not celebrated like the ending is.Maybe some people were impressed with the plot device of an angel showing George what life might have been like without him. Maybe that was the first time that had been done in a movie, for all I know. But I found that device not unlike the ghosts who visit Scrooge, and that tale was written long before It's A Wonderful Life was made. So I don't get that, either.There were some fun moments, and who doesn't like Jimmy Stewart. But a revered classic? I guess I don't get it. I gave it a 5.",

This is a man whose life is one of great significance, but he,  like all of us, does not always realize that this is so. He does not  recognize his impact on the world until an angel erases his existence  like chalk on a board. It is then that he is hit by the fact that one  man's failing life isn't always as inconsequential as it may seem.  We all remember when Clarence (Henry Travers) first appears on that  snowy bridge and saves George Bailey (James Stewart) from committing  suicide. He explains nonchalantly that he is an angel and George is  incredulous--until Clarence wipes away his entire past. His mother  doesn't recognize him. George tells her about his uncle as a source of  belief. She states that his uncle has been dead for some time, now.  The best scene in the entire film is that following when George is  thrown out by his mother. He runs towards the camera in an intense wide  shot, his face registering emotions of fear, horror, and ultimately the  horrid understanding of what has happened. This role is the highlight  of James Stewart's career--he never came anywhere close to the superb  performance he gives in this movie. There is a reason it was his  favorite film he ever starred in.  Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is the grown image of all of us:  As a child he dreamed of nothing but exotic locations and adventurous  travels to foreign lands. But now he is a family man, a father and a  husband. He has left behind his silly bachelor notions, but they still  come back to haunt him. Bailey owns the town savings and loan, left to  him by his father. The cranky Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) wants  complete monopoly over the town, and all that stands in his way is  Bailey and his little bank. But Bailey, an inner disgust and hatred  towards Potter brewing since his childhood days, refuses to cave in and  give it all away.  Then one day, George's absentminded and quite eccentric uncle (Thomas  Mitchell), misplaces a large sum of money, leaving George hopeless and  Potter with a serious advantage. After blowing up at his wife (Donna  Reed) and kids at home, George gets drunk at a local bar, is scorned at  by a schoolteacher's wife, and left dazed and confused, walking through  the snowy town at night during the happy Christmas season without a  hope in the world. Battered and delirious, thinking back over his  apparently pointless and wasted life, he contemplates suicide. He prays  to God and wishes that he had never existed. Which is why Clarence  comes down from heaven to sort things out and answer his prayer.  Essentially bombing at the box office when it was first released, and  then proceeding to fall into copyright problems for years, \"It's a  Wonderful Life\" resurfaced only years later when it was brought back  into the public domain circa 1970. When other channels were airing  expensive Hollywood movies during the Christmas season, PBS picked up  the film and played it as a counter attack, a weak hope prevailing in  them that the classic film buffs out there would tune in. They did. And  so did families across the nation. Every year the ratings got stronger  and stronger and now, almost sixty years following the movie's initial  release, it is considered a holiday tradition.  George considers suicide as a way of escaping his problems without  really thinking over the possible outcomes given his final choice. He  looks back upon his life as wasted potential; he wanted to become an  adventurer, break his family's small-town tradition and become  something huge. Mentally scanning his life to the point in time when he  stands on that bridge, George Bailey believes that he has simply and  truly created a waste of space. He's ready to end his (assumed)  pointless life when his entire point of view is wholly altered by the  power of God. George suddenly realizes that though he never lived out  his boyhood fantasies, he did so much more than he ever dreamed of. He  saved his brother's life, which resulted in a huge impact in later  years; he made an influence in the lives of others and brought peace  and harmony to an otherwise small town by prevailing at the requests of  Mr. Potter; he married a beautiful wife and had children, all of whom  will no doubt have some measure of significance later in the world. And  his wish on that bridge was that he had never been born.  Often I am asked to name my favorite movie, and though I ignore  requests and state that I have not seen every existing movie and  therefore my judgment carries no significance, I have the lightest  whimsy that \"It's a Wonderful Life\" may be my favorite motion picture  to date. I cherish few other films just as close, but to me, \"It's a  Wonderful Life\" is more moving than \"Casablanca,\" a better study of one  man's life than \"Citizen Kane,\" and a movie that will live on in the  hearts and memory of viewers long after we are gone. I believe that  this is the definitive Americana motion picture, regardless of how I  compare it to my other favorites, which may carry the same weight but  not the same true significance. Few films come as close to the heart as  \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" And few films come as close to \"It's a  Wonderful Life\" at all, for that matter.  5/5.",

Jimmy Stewart had that unique ability to put the Everyman into his roles, and this picture certainly qualifies as one of his finest performances. Donna Reed could not have been a better choice to play Mary, displaying a wholesome sex appeal to go along with those traditional home town American values that pictures of the era were so skillful in portraying. Had Director Frank Capra made only this one picture, it would have earned him recognition as one of the true masters of cinema. I could go on and on, but there's really no point in trying to heap further accolades on a picture that has earned it's place in American film right at the top.

George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.\"It's a Wonderful Life\" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"A Felicidade não se Compra\" (\"The Happiness Is not Bought\")",

What follows is lengthy and often profound, an occasionally twee but ultimately moving exploration of the human character and the effect one man can have on his world.What I particularly liked about IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is the way that every part of the narrative hangs together without any unnecessary extras. Even the little bits like the accident on the ice at the outset later come back to haunt our characters. It's very well written, and expertly directed by Frank Capra; an unashamedly old-fashioned, heart-warming and sentimental piece of movie-making on a grand scale. I'd even go so far as to call it the ultimate Christmas film.",

            "text": "This is an article from www.richtwinpoortwin (dot) com I hope all of you had a Merry Christmas. It's A Wonderful Life is a good classic movie. It will always bring back fond memories. For many years since we can remember, my twin and I saw the classic movie: It's A Wonderful Life air at our old home. We switched the channel every year when the movie just started because the movie is in black and white. We just dismissed the movie and thought it would be a bore. A few years later when we were in college, freshman year. one of our best professors we had in our academic years had this movie as part of the curriculum - where we watched the movie and did the usual analysis on the movie. I didn't know it at the time, but he was a very good professor and person. He actually was searching for a purpose, more in life, the meaning of life, happiness in life, the reason for living, etc. He was actually trying to wake us up. But I digress; we will talk about this professor in upcoming entries. Now back to It's a wonderful life. The movie is quite enjoyable.We recently went back to NYC this Christmas and watched It's a Wonderful life for the first time in our old home. I recall the analysis we did after watching the show in college. We all came up with the all too familiar analysis of how Potter was rich, greedy, and evil. And how George Bailey was the good person, the hero who was doing what was right - he was fighting the good fight so that everyone else can have a wonderful life in Bedford Falls.There was a common theme painted throughout the movie: being good/doing good meant sacrificing yourself - physically, mentally, and financially- George risked his life to save his brother Harry (lost his hearing in his left ear), getting beaten up by his childhood boss after saving a client from being poisoned, taking a job that was below him in order to save the Bank and the community from Potter, getting married to Mary because just to make his mother happy, turning down Sam Wayne Wright's offer, giving away 2 thousand dollars of his own hard earned money he saved for his honeymoon to others during the bank run on black Friday, and turning down Potter's offer that would have freed him.It's A Wonderful Life enforces the idea that having money meant you are greedy, evil, selfish, lazy, cruel, racist, lonely, bitter, uncaring, and that you will lose your money as fast as you made it throughout the movie. Potter was the living symbol of this commonly accepted false idea. Potter is a \"warped, frustrated, old man.\" He was crippled and pushed around in a wheelchair. He has no family, was uncaring - he called for a board meeting to resolve the bank after Bailey Senior's death, was a racist - he refers to his tenants as \"garlic eaters\", has a skull on his desk, cruel - he withholds foolish Uncle Ben's $8000 cash deposit just to get back at the Baileys, and he levied harsh rent from his poor tenants, and on the last scene where we see what would happen if he controlled Bedford falls - it would be called Potter's field where Bedford falls is just a grave yard, there would be less of the \"neighborly\", lots of bars, clubs, and gambling.But when we watched the movie at home, we see that the movie: It's a Wonderful Life is nothing more than propaganda. Its message is worse than its character Potter, himself. The movie tells its audience to just Settle. That is perhaps the worst and most dangerous message of all - be a noob, don't even try to become a pwner. The movie's message tells you to just try to find the good things that you have and not to try harder, not to help yourself, not to pursue your dreams, and just help others because you are seen as greedy if you try to pursue your dreams before helping others. In short - mind others businesses, help as many as you can with what little you have and look for \"the good things\" that you have and you shall be happy and you will have a wonderful life. The last message of the movie was \" A man is never poor as long as he has friends,\" which is true to some degree but the movie's bigger message and idea is troubling.What if Clarence showed George Bailey actually achieving what he wanted?? As in showing George what he, his wife, and the rest of Bedford Falls would be if George would have achieved what he wanted to do - go to college, travel the world, build bridges, build skyscrapers, and become what he wanted to BE since he was a small boy - in short living his childhood dream. But instead Clarence CHEATED him and US by just showing how unhappy the community would be if he was not born. And it is very fascinating how Sam Wayne Wright becomes what George Bailey always wanted to be - rich, traveling the world, having a company, wives, power, fame, fancy cars and FREE from having to put his nose to the grind stone.And that is all I have to say about that. Or what Sam would say, \"Hee-Haw!\"",

In fact, I can't remember the last time I actually watched it in its entirety. I realize the reason why now...it's Frank Capra's populist message. It had finally gotten under my craw.The message, that having money is EVIL but being altruistic and broke is GOOD, served Capra well during the depression when everyone was broke (ironically, Capra got rich off this message). By 1946, Americans had money again and populism had worn out its welcome, which might explain the movie's dismal box office take.George Bailey is altruism squared. He willingly becomes a doormat to townfolks who can't spoonfeed themselves, forgoing his goals and dreams of making his own life better. Sorry George, but I eventually lost sympathy for you. Your desires are equally important.Other characters I got even more fed up with: Uncle Billy...what a drunken bonehead! Cmon, George, I don't care if he is family. Either fire this rumdum or make him into a harmless janitor or something so he won't go losing $8000 at a clip. Harry Bailey, you're next! You have no intention of ever paying back George for your college education, am I right? And finally, Clarence Oddbody,AS2. No wonder you haven't gotten your wings, you doofus. You knew about the $8000, so tell George that Potter stole the money so he, Mary, and the rest of the family could storm the bank and clean his clock like in the Saturday Night Live skit from 1986. Yes, I know that last part was played for laughs, but wouldn't that be your gut response, though? Maybe my criticism is a bit harsh, but it's towards the populist message and story line. I still like the acting in it, and the special effects were very good for the time...Capra's fake snow all over Bedford Falls still looks realistic to this day. And as goofy and manipulative as it seems, I'm glad George's deadbeat customers finally paid him back in the end. (P.S.: George, this would be a good time to remind your brother, Harry The War Hero, that he owes you four years of college tuition and the cost of a long distance phone call!)",

            "text": "I went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the 'top five' Oscars (for Best Picture, Best actor, Best actress, Best director and best screenplay) and has been praised as \"one of Jack Nicholson's finest roles\" and \"one of the classics of the 70's\". Naturally, after hearing all this, I had high expectations for One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. But nonetheless, I was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praise.Based on the novel by Ken Kesey, the story follows Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who, in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison, pleads insanity for his crime, and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution. This was McMurphy's intention, as he believes the conditions in a \"crazy house\" will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison. However, he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with it's desolate patients (including Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito, Vincent Schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant Brad Dourif as the stuttering Billy Bibbit) and the monstrously repressive Nurse Ratchet (Louise Fletcher, in a career defining role) is considerably harder than he imagined. McMurphy plays pranks, horseplay, and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits. His constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting, and often quite funny as well, but much of the movie can be very depressing - the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently (and intentionally) bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet ending.Jack Nicholson is at his best here, head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in 'Chinatown' or 'As Good as it Gets'. McMurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist, refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients. His livewire antics, inspiring the patients are generally uplifting, and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken, we really feel for him and his fellow patients. Nicholson conveys the essence of McMurphy to perfection, demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character. When McMurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape, the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it, despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him. When McMurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts, he cannot lift the fountain, he is so openly crushed that we can't help but feel for him. Beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics, there are real human emotions, which come across as truly touching.What can be said about One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest which hasn't already been said? It has an excellent storyline, top notch acting, painfully bleak visuals, perfectly setting the tone for the movie, and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing. It features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever, next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset, and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions, unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in it's glorious entirety. It's hard to produce a final outcome any better than this.-10/10",

            "text": "Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the \"mental illness\" card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their \"therapy\" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be \"dealt with.\"A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched \"isn't that bad\" or that \"she was only trying to do her job\", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in \"Mommie Dearest,\" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that \"appearances\" are not about inward reality and, worse, \"the letter kills.\"Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of \"Chief\" Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A",

This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10",

I've seen many movies, but there aren't much movies which had such an impact on me. Nowadays almost all filmmakers believe they can only make a good movie by adding loads of special effects and lots of huge explosions ... This movie is so good, so convincing without them. The actors played their roles in such a convincing way that you would think these weren't actors at all, but real psychiatric patients.This movie may be 30 years old, but it hasn't lost any of its relevancy. OK, we don't put our mentally ill people in that kind of prisons anymore, the bars in front of the windows have gone and now we call it hospitals in stead of nut houses. But the treatment hasn't changed all that much. I once worked in such a hospital as a volunteer and still saw things like forced feeding, giving people so much medication until they no longer know who or where they are,...When the movie first came out, some people were shocked because when you watch the movie, you can't help it feeling more attached to the patients than to the doctors and nurses. This movie shows that cinema can make a difference. It can help to open people's eyes. If there is a movie that should be seen by everyone, this sure is the one. I give it a well deserved 10/10.",

He makes friends with lunatics and starts his own circle of admiration within the hospital, much to the dismay of Nurse Ratched, the central authority figure in the story and one of the greatest movie villains ever.The movie exists to show not only how corrupt and poorly-constructed society's approach to the \"mentally unstable\" is, but it creates characters that we have all met in life and shows how the McMurphy-like figure that we all wish we had fights for freedom of choice and basic human rights. In addition to the movie's great spirit, the acting is fantastic. Jack Nicholson is at his best and Danny DeVito can be seen in his very first acting role ( which he absolutely triumphs in ). And of course, there's the unforgettable Chief Bromden. The directing by Milos Forman is very well-done, as the camera-work is excellent and follows the pace of the movie perfectly in how it is used. What really impressed me was the editing, especially as far as the use of audio goes: some parts just made me go \"...wow.\"My only complaint is that I believe the movie could've been slightly more effective if it were based more closely on the novel at certain points, but the modified point of view of the film does make a great point; anyone who has ever hated their job, been accused of something, had some person so self-righteous and convinced of their own authority and dependency on order get in your way, or attended the American public school system at any point in their life should be able to identify with this movie.",

            "text": "The opening shot of ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a bleak  glance at an Oregon morning.  Stirring, haunting music plays gracefully on the soundtrack and a car approaches.  Inside the car is one of film history's most remarkable characters.   \"Randle McMurphy\" is about to bring hope, humor, and a glimmer of reality to some disturbed people in a mental hospital. Jack Nicholson as \"McMurphy\", is something of a paradox.  Is this guy crazy or is he really the lazy, conniving criminal most believe him to be?  That is the magical mystery and start to a journey into mental illness and the effect this man will have on some truly messed up men.Milos Forman directs this all-time classic, which swept the Oscars deservedly, and holds up so well 25 years later.  It is a simplistic film about small people living in their own small worlds.  Manic moments are mixed with poignant acting all leading to an astounding climax.  Not before or since CUCKOO'S NEST has a collection of different characters had such an impact on me.  You could write a book report about each of the patients in the ward.  The two most important people here are, of course, Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher.Nicholson has his greatest moments in this picture.  One brilliant scene has him doing an imaginary play-by-play commentary of the 1963 World Series to the group, who are not allowed to watch the game on TV.  It is a poetic sequence and Nicholson goes crazy with his delivery, describing baseball with colorful anecdotes and profanity.  \"McMurphy\" immediately makes an impression on the crazies and shows them how they don't have to stick to the \"normal routine\".  He knows their names right away, he sprays them with water, he makes impossible bets with them, he introduces them to fishing, and he even gets a suffering young kid (played well by Brad Dourif) a \"date\".  Louise Fletcher plays one of the more reprehensible human beings in film as \"Nurse Mildred Ratched\".  She is a hardened woman, one who makes the daily meetings with the group a contest to see who will win.  Her stubbornness and lack of compassion for the poor guys is rather one dimensional.  That's perfect because that is exactly who she is.  Her strong will to keep things monotonous leads to a final showdown with the free spirited \"McMurphy\" in what is easily one of the most shocking and disturbing climaxes in recent memory.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST does not try to make a statement about mental illness or how the unstable should be treated.  Rather, it is a very simple portrait of the long days and hilarious scenarios that can come about when a mixed bag of suffering people are thrown together.  Mental illness is nothing to laugh about, but the fact that Nicholson is not really crazy (at least in my opinion) allows us to be amused.  He seems to love his compadres in the hospital.  He is mislead, however, into thinking he can do as he pleases.There is no denying the power of CUCKOO'S NEST.  The two main powerhouse performances are golden, the cinematography is morbid and gritty like it should be, the \"Chief\" is great as Nicholson's right hand, ah, protagonist, and you care a lot about what will happen as the film moves on.  The famous, final shot ironically happens to be an exit of a major character into that bleak, Oregon morning. NOTE: I have never read the book and I find it hard to believe author Ken Kesey has never watched the filmed version.  Comparing a book to a movie is impossible.  They are 2 distinctly different artistic methods of story-telling.",

Just when you thought there was no justice in the world, Jack finally came through with \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\".  The film is exceptional in every sense imaginable. Nicholson stars as a prisoner who is sent to an insane asylum.  While there, Nicholson creates an atmosphere which gives his fellow inmates a sense of self-worth and a glimmer of happiness.  Throughout, it is never made clear whether Nicholson is truly insane or just acting crazy to get out of manual labor at the regular prison.  Whatever the case, Nicholson is creating a place that head-nurse Louise Fletcher (Oscar-winning) is finding unsuitable for the other patients.  She is quietly evil and amazingly cruel to those within the asylum.  Nicholson and Fletcher are getting ready for a head-on-collision that will prove to be the decisive factor at the end of the movie.  Will Sampson, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif (Oscar-nominated) are all great in supporting turns as Nicholson's fellow inmates.  An excellent film.  5 stars out of 5.",

But as I've said before, whatever makes me want to read the original source material is probably a good movie.OFOCN is a story about the various events that happens in a mental institution after Randall McMurphy, expertly played by our brilliant Mr. Jack Nicholson, is introduced to the place. His rebellious and playful nature and magnetic presence start to slowly influence the eccentric inmates, who I felt that they were all unique and well performed. McMurphy, by all means, was violent but not mentally ill. He distances himself from the rest of the inmates by calling them several alternatives for \"insane\" while simultaneously encouraging them to leave after learning that the very few are actually institutionalized involuntarily. This is by far the most interesting piece of the film. In fact, most of the inmates are fine though they display some childlike attitude and innocence. Yes, they have deficiencies but not enough to house them in such a place by any standard. But every single one of them has no desire to leave because of the prison they've created in their mind. Take Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) for an example. He has a stuttering issue and he claims that he's not ready to leave the institution even though he's voluntary. His prison, or his fear seems to be his mother and rejection by female figures. As soon as he sleeps with a prostitute, indicating that some of his fears may have subsided, his stutter disappears. But the moment Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) brings up his mother, his stutter begins and he subsequently takes his own life. All of this shows that Billy's imprisoned in his own fear, a weight that was unbearable for him. The institution does have some influence on his behavior with characters such as Nurse Ratched, but the biggest barrier to the freedom of the inmates was their self.The idea of this movie being a cautionary tale begins to be clearer as we see Randall's progression over the film and his crusade against conformity. In the beginning, he actually escapes and brings the inmates to a fishing trip. He tries one more time but falls asleep at the open window. The next opportunity he has, he voluntarily makes the decision to stay. I took this as how the environment and those around you can affect your mindset. The \"Chief\" (Will Sampson) realizes that Randall who has lost all will to escape is as good as dead and decides to put him out of his misery. The chief, whose escape was the least likely and the most illegal as he was institutionalized involuntarily, actually escapes after understanding the dangers of inaction.I was at a bit of loss what to make out of the movie but I concluded that it encourages to break out of our shells and our fears once in a while. Or it would deafen and mute you for the rest of your life. I don't believe that the movie makes clear-cut messages about how to act. However, I still believe it is a valuable one because it makes you ponder about aforementioned topics, which certainly makes this movie deserving of winning all 5 major Academy awards.",

            "text": "'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975), based on the novel by Ken Kesey and directed by Milos Forman, centers around R.P McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) a prisoner serving time for the statutory rape of a 15 year old, among other things. In an attempt to escape from the work yards in the penitentiary, McMurphy fakes a mental illness, leading to him being admitted into a mental hospital. There, he befriends many of the other patients in the ward and attempts to break them out of the strict and monotonous routine set by Head Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).OK, first of all, it has to be said, I had quite high expectations for this movie. It came highly recommend by both my parents, is number 8 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and won the grand slam at the 1975 Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). However, I was left extremely disappointed with this film.While the first 20 minutes seem promising, showcasing Nicholsons immense talent, the film drags for the next hour, trying to convince you to love McMurphy and loathe Nurse Ratchet, unsuccessfully, I will add. Which brings me to my first and largest problem with this film. On the back of my DVD case it states that \"Nurse Ratchet is among the coldly monstrous villains in film history\". Based upon that assessment, I expected numerous unnecessary, unethical punishments, and a complete lack of care for her patients. Well I did not receive that, no instead we got a firm, cold, woman that takes charge of her ward, filled with mentally unstable and perhaps dangerous people, with an iron fist, being nothing but a true reflection of the mental health system at the time. That being said, I am not in anyway completely condoning her behavior. She is far too cold to be an effective nurse and her use of manipulation would not be accepted in today's society. However to asses her as being the one of most wicked, evil, heartless is completely and utter over exaggeration and unfortunately paints the film in a 'State vs Rebel' way.Which leads also to my other major problem with this film. McMurphy, is not likable. At least not to me. He is an arrogant, self-centered 'rebel', who has made the rather laughable decision to get himself committed to this mental hospital as he is tired of the prison work yard. But no, we are supposed to cheer him on in his attempts to rid the ward of rules and boundaries, in other words, 'fight the system'. Perhaps it was 'in' to rebel against the state in the 70's? To me this film reeked of this ideology, spoiling much of it.There are certainly positives to 'One Flew Over' and I can understand on one level why is rated so highly by many critics and audiences. It is well directed, the acting by the two leads, regardless of my objection of the use of their characters, is extremely well done but I do not believe it to be Nicholsons best work, as many praise it to be. There are genuine funny moments to be had and a certain scene revolving around cigarettes is the perfect example of acting at its best. The last 20 minutes is also very well executed and left me somewhat vindicated.Overall however, the particular framing of the 2 leads left me simply annoyed with this film and as such, I was left underwhelmed.",

            "text": "The 1970s were the golden age of politicised cinema. Race, sexuality and militarism all came under fire more than ever before. Meanwhile, the loosening up of codes governing motion picture content meant that pictures were now more frank about sex, violence and other taboos. While this was generally a good thing, what it really brought out was that for all the social advancement going on women were still very much the losers in the sexual revolution. A case in point is One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, a picture of spiteful misogyny wrapped in the politics of mental health.Now I'm not normally one to pick apart a movie for \"hidden\" meanings, but in this case the subtext is unequivocal, unpleasant, and has rarely been discussed. It begins as early as the excusing of McMurphy's criminal past. In the first scene at Doctor Spivey's office his conviction for statutory rape is played down, passed off as natural, and the fault of the girl in any case. On the ward, it is the tyranny of women in authority that keeps the all-male patient group down, preventing them from enjoying such stereotypically masculine pursuits as gambling over cards, watching baseball, going fishing and, of course, getting laid. Even the handful of females in the story whom we never see – Billy's overbearing mother, Harding's unfaithful wife – are portrayed as villains and causes of the patients' being committed. The only acceptable women in this worldview are ones like Candy; they don't answer back, aren't educated and aren't fussy who they sleep with.But of course, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is hailed as a passionate plea for the rights and dignity of mental patients. And it does truly make some commendable points about institutionalisation. It gets a lot of things wrong too though. The idea that those diagnosed with mental illness do not require professional attention has never been substantiated (on a side note, isn't it interesting how the mid-70s was also the time when the anti-psychiatric cult Scientology first began to gain currency in Hollywood?) It's also worth pointing out that lobotomies do not leave people in a vegetative state, and while I would never condone the procedure, the implication that a lobotomy renders someone fit only for euthanasia is an insult to all the living people who have undergone one. And surely the message of the movie is somewhat blunted by the fact that it's set fifteen or twenty years before it was made, during which time there had been significant reform in mental health provision. Of course, the movie's defenders may say the exact accuracy of the psychiatric hospital setting are irrelevant, as it is supposed to be a metaphor for something more wide-reaching. I suspect that \"something\" is little more than Ken Kesey's misogyny.In spite of all this however, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is admittedly very well made. Milos Forman is a superb director, one who eschews long takes but makes remarkable use of multiple camera set-ups. His shots, while not exactly glaring close-ups, are nevertheless composed to focus us entirely on people, with very few wide-shots. This has the effect that we become barely aware of the dimensions of the set but become totally absorbed in the human story. One of the most brilliantly crafted scenes is the first ward meeting where they discuss Harding's problems with his wife. Forman keeps several of the \"chronics\" in the background of those talking-head shots, both to remind us of their existence, and also for the dynamics of the scene – for example Bancini's twitching arm which sets the pace of the mounting tension. Forman's coverage and the magnificent editing by Richard Chew create a very rhythmic form of visual storytelling for the scene's conclusion, as we cut from the agitated Bancini being lead away by the orderlies, to Vincent Schiavelli resignedly puffing out cigarette smoke, to Jack Nicholson's accusing glance at Louise Fletcher, to her steely and self-satisfied glare. It's as if every shot is a subtle comment on the one that went before it.Speaking of Nicholson and Fletcher, one cannot ignore the superlative acting in this picture. In the lead role Nicholson is completely unbridled, simply letting his trademark wild-man act run riot, and yet he tempers it with moments of seriousness, dropping the act and becoming compellingly real for example when he proposes to rip out the hydrotherapy unit and escape. Fletcher by contrast is a model of understatement. Just below the icy exterior you can see her anger and resentment bubbling away, and even when she does give way to her emotions you can see her character trying to restrain them and maintain that professional gloss, spitting out her lines through clenched teeth. Each of the patient characters is superbly cast, with performances that range between attention-grabbing craziness to devastating realism, and this goes for the men playing the so-called chronics as well.One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest is a massively popular and highly-acclaimed movie, and though I have some huge reservations about it, I can fully understand why it is so widely enjoyed. It's themes and ideologies are often abhorrent – a fact that should not be overlooked – but it is undoubtedly a stunning piece of cinema.",

Just think about Larry Flynt in \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" or Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie.

Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall: The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.",

            "text": "Not many movies have won the \"big five\" in the academy awards. It's enough to win just best picture for a lot of movies. This movie portrays every film element to the highest degree, from the beautiful panoramic shots of the mountains outside of the mental institution to the story of ultimate redemption McMurphy and Chief find at the end.The movie is seen through the eyes of Randle McMurphy (Nicholson). He is sent to the mental institution because he would rather be considered \"insane\" and live in \"luxury\" other than being a jailbird in prison. Once he gets into the actual living area where the insane are, he looks up at this tall, native looking man they call \"Chief\". McMurphy's initial reaction to Chief was his little Indian dance he did to mock him, but once Chief didn't react McMurphy asked him if he played football and says to chief, \"God damn, boy, you're as big as a mountain.\" Little by little, you could see their friendship start to unfold out throughout the movie.In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the title \"villain\" would definitely belong to Nurse Ratched. She gave threats to the patients, she was even friends with one of the patient's (Billy) mom. She also tries to toy with McMurphy's mind by trying to get him to conform with the customs of mental facility. It doesn't work out for her as planned. Including a classic scene where Nurse Ratched's threats cause little Billy to commit suicide. In rage, McMurphy has seen enough and actually chokes her out. This causes McMurphy to go through a lobotomy and become a vegetable at his stay at the clinic.I know many people probably disagree with this but, I think Chief killing McMurphy at the end was beautiful as much as it was heartbreaking. It symbolized that McMurphy, still had a chance to redeem himself and become a hero, even if it were death. It also gave Chief clearance to finally \"escape\" the premises and \"fly from the cuckoo's nest\", and how he did it at the end was classic. That's what makes this movie one of the greatest of all time, not only because of the sensational acting and the sociological significance, but because of the message and symbolism of the story.The directing by Milos Foreman was phenomenal, not only with the memorable acting by Jack Nicholson, but with the camera shots he used in certain scenes. For example, the scene before McMurphy was about to get electro-shock therapy they show a very close up angle of him to show the intensity and crowdedness he had to go through while getting the shock treatment. Nicholson also makes it pretty believable that he is actually getting shocked, by making \"gurgling\" noises and such.They actually go back to the \"lying down\" closed angle shot at the end of the movie when Nicholson passes away. I thought it was very brave of the director to keep that long shot of McMurphy's dead self, because by making it last as though it were a still shot, to me it seemed more and more believable that McMurphy was actually dead. I don't know how Nicholson just lied there stiff as a board. I know he may have won his Oscar because of his heroic and charismatic character, but how he dealt with himself in those two scenes is what tickles my fancy.The ideology of this film is, in my opinion, what makes it one of the greatest of all time. The story brings up the question of who's actually the insane; McMurphy and his patients, or Nurse Ratched and the staff? Clinically, McMurphy was not insane. Even the doctors and professors stated that, but since he didn't follow the norms and the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched, he had to stay at the sanitarium longer. I also loved the allusion of Chief, by acting deaf and dumb. He played the omniscient or \"god-like\" role of hearing and seeing everything, yet not saying anything himself. It almost seems as he was the narrating the story until he befriended McMurphy.I don't know if I could think of a more evil villain in a movie other than Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). The evil looks she gave to her patients when they were doing something wrong was as cold-hearted as one could get. Also her audacity to tell Billy's mother about his sexual deviance is as sinister as you can get. She knew that it would hurt Billy deeply, which was a major reason he was \"insane\" is because of his relationship with his mother. He eventually killed himself, angering McMurphy.I never thought I would cheer out loud when a grown man was choking out a little woman, but I did here. This scene did a fantastic job of not making it taboo, but making you want her dead even more. This did change Nurse Ratched however, it made her a little nicer to the patients at the end and made her realize that if she abuses her power as a nurse, it can come back to haunt her.The meaning of this story is wonderful and helped Jack Nicholson set the bar for acting. The symbolism of Chief's and McMurphy's redemption serves as a corner stone for many many movies today. Whether it be the costumes of the patients, the crazy acting, or even the beautiful classic shot at the end of the movie where Chief runs out to freedom; This movie will never be forgotten. And it serves as a good lesson for everyone out there who feels left out can all come together and get freedom. I advise anybody who says they love movies to watch this film, because it will not only change your views, it will change your life and you can't say that about a lot of movies.",

I had high expectations knowing all the rewards that rained down on it, but the film and Jack Nicholson's performance in particular still managed to surprise me.R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is transferred to a mental institution for evaluation after given a short sentence on a prison farm for statutory rape charges. He tries to make the most of his suspected short stay in the hospital and challenges the head nurse (Louise Fletcher) at every chance he gets.Anthony Hopkins has done a great intelligent psychopath, but no one does crazy better than Nicholson. I loved his performance in \"The Shining\" and am ashamed to say I have yet to see \"As Good as it Gets\" (one of three movies he won best actor Oscars for). He delivered an average performance in \"The Departed\" and isn't getting any younger, but I do hope he gives us at least one more role that comes close to the show he put on in Cuckoo's Nest. Watching his interaction with the other patients made me believe on some occasions I was seeing a comedy, but the movie quickly reminds us it can be just as depressing as it is funny.It's hard to find fault with \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Louise Fletcher did a great job as the leading actress and strong performances by all the supporting characters made the movie brilliant. Good screenplay, good directing and the music by Jack Nitzsche played nicely with the film.I've seen some hate about the ending, but in my opinion it couldn't have been better. McMurthy could have jump out of the window when he had the chance and I think most of us were rooting for him to do so, but what he does next shows the strong bond formed with his odd friends inside the hospital.The movie left me emotionally blank for a while and then I just felt sad. I'm not going to drop any major spoilers on this site as I know some of you still haven't seen it, but it's one of the few movies that have truly left me staring at the end credits in awe.Conclusion:It ranks as one of the best in my book alongside \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"Pulp Fiction\". See this movie with the highest expectations and chances are it will surpass them!250moviereviews.wordpress.com",

A chilling, disturbing, and revealing look into the mental institutions as seen through the eyes of a con. Jack Nicholson, Louise Fletcher, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito, and Christopher Lloyd, round out the excellent, and very well casted cast.Jack Nicholson brilliantly plays Randall Patrick McMurphy, an ex-con, who fakes being mentally insane, to enter the institution. As he goes to the hospital, he doesn't realize, that the people, and the atmosphere there is so out there. The patients are really psycho, and creepy. Randall, must try and survive these days, before he has to go to Jail. He has to entertain himself while at the same time, find good in this place of craziness.Lousie Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched, a soft; but strong willed nurse, who will not take anything from anyone, or put up with misbehavior. She watches Randall, and notices something different about him, he's not as psycho as the others, but he is a little out there. Her job is tough indeed, having to put up with all these men, who don't listen, some go crazy and throw fits, and others just sit there and don't do anything.Randall meets many new friends in this place, Brad Dourif who plays Billy Bibbit, is a mentally unstable, but voluntarily institutionalized person. Danny DeVito plays Martini, a slow but charming and sweet man, who means know harm in what he does or say. Christopher Lloyd plays Taber, a man, who also voluntarily institutionalized himself. He also meets Chief, a big 'dumb, and deaf' Indian, who happens to like to play basketball. Randall must try and survive these days with his new friends, and the hospital, as well as an everlasting war as to which they can watch the world series on TV. Put up with Nurse Ratched, and the other patients, doctors, vistors, and nurses. Ultimately leading up to a dramatic finale, that makes you want to stand up and cheer.I think what was best about this film was the realism. I had no problem believing that this was happening. Almost like a documentary, it was striking and powerful, making the viewer not want to stop watching till the end. Some of the sequences are memorable as the basketball game, and the fishing trip. Jack Nicholson, who as always plays his character absolutely excellent, and makes the viewer want to hand him an Oscar himself.The supporting cast, Louise Fletcher, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, and Brad Dourif also give terrific performances. Danny, Christopher, and Brad's careers all were made with this superb movie. It's all sentimental, funny, dramatic, intense, chilling, disturbing, diverting, and tragic. The finale leaves the viewer stunned and sitting there thinking about what he just saw. See this film, and believe it. I think you will find, its one of the BEST ever.The second film to win all five major Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Fletcher), Director, and Screenplay. And it deserved all of them.Rated R for language, violence, sexual content, and brief nudity.",

You feel so much hate for nurse Ratched. All the other actors are brilliant in their roles. You kind of want to slap them in the face and wake them up to face reality. The daily routines in the mental institute would even drive a normal person completely bonkers. I saw this movie so many times without getting bored once.

            "text": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) **** (out of 4)What can one say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Winner of five Academy Awards, director Milos Foreman's ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is without question one of the greatest movies ever made and I think it also contains some of the greatest assembled acting that you're ever going to witness.Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is put into a hospital where he's going to be evaluated and right from the start this rebel butts heads with the main nurse (Louise Fletcher). That's pretty much all you need to know about the story because the great characters and the remarkable story just captures you and doesn't let you go until the end credits.There's a lot of credit that deserves to be shared in why this film is so special but you really have to start with Nicholson. If you look at his filmography during this period, it's really remarkable to see the type of roles he was doing. It's also easy to see how these type of films certainly wouldn't be made in today's age and time. Today rebels are shown to be tough guys with no weak spots but films like FIVE EASY PIECES, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE and this one show that the tough rebel can also be highly flawed and not always win.Nicholson's performance here is simply flawless and there's not one false move throughout. It doesn't matter if he's just laughing at what's going on around him or connecting with one of the other characters. It's really hard to think of anyone in the history of cinema doing more with the role than what Nicholson did. Fletcher is also extremely good but for other reasons. It's not so much her \"performance\" but the simple ways she looks at the other characters. She expresses so much with her eyes that you can see why she's able to get the Nicholson character to bring out so much anger and rage. The supporting cast members are all flawless in their own right and really make this one of the most memorable assemble pieces ever put together. Brad Dourif certainly deserves special attention as the troubled Billy.Everything from the music score to the editing to the way the story is build is done with such perfection that I really have no problem in calling this one of the greatest films ever made. The film is full of emotional highs and lo's but this is yet another reason it's so memorable.",

Significant story inconsistencies and a good deal of ill-logic as to what the patients/inmates are able to get away with - all to further the story, but it's forced and comes across as not credible. Didn't they have alarms on windows and doors in the 60s at such institutions? The Nicholson character being able to get over barbed wire with no injuries - not reasonable. Seems likely. Well over the top performances, especially by Jack N; not unusual. Why he got so much acclaim for overacting is hard for me to figure. Some of his roles are excellently done, but many, like this one, are just him showing off - in my opinion. In summary, an overlong, often dull and obvious story.",

Firstly, movie is very hypocritical in its treatment of the patients by wanting us to feel compassion (fair enough) while making fun of their afflictions. There is the lead actor. Nicholson's performance is fine, if he's playing Jack Nicholson but what's all this anti-hero talk. McMurphy comes across as a completely selfish and self-eserving figure, without much humanity or compassion for others. Louis Fletcher plays Nurse Ratched in a somnambulistic state, dreary monotone and is about as threatening as Audrey Hepburn. Milos Forman's direction is uneven and reflects the hypocrisy of the entire project. This man must surely be one of the most over-rated directors of the era as well.'Cuckoo's Nest' (the title alone proves the hypocrisy point)is'nt one-tenth the movie Nashville is and mainly won all its awards strictly because audiences of the time (and still apparently now)seem to fall for its phony pandering, false emotions and blatent audience manipulation. If these comments help bring the picture down a bit from its lofty position on the top 250 list, then I have done my duty.",

            "text": "It took a dozen years for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest to make it to the big screen from Broadway. In 1962 Kirk Douglas made his one and only return to Broadway to star as Randall P. McMurphy on stage with Joan Tetzel as his nemesis, nurse Ratched. Douglas bought the screen rights, but by the time anyone was interested in doing the film version, Kirk was too old for the part.That may have been a break for the movie fans because as much as I like Kirk Douglas, I can't see anyone but Jack Nicholson doing this role as the free spirited McMurphy. McMurphy's a low level career criminal type who statutorily raped a girl as he put it '15 going on 35'. He decides to fake a crazy act while in prison to get out of the work farm he's assigned to.So Nicholson's goes to the mental hospital where he meets an odd assortment of people whom he discovers voluntarily checked themselves in there, mainly because it's easier to stay there and not take all your psychological baggage into society. That's a crucial difference that Nicholson finds out the hard way, his new friends most of them can pack up and leave anytime they want. He's sent there by the state and the state determines when he's ready to go even if it's past the allotted jail time he was sentenced to.The state in this case is Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched, one of the great Dickensian names ever given a movie character. Louise is the ultimate control freak and these people who've shut themselves away from life are her ultimate tools. When Nicholson comes in, he hasn't given up on life like the rest of these poor souls, he becomes a threat to Fletcher's little empire.It's hard to believe that such a smart guy like McMurphy would not have known the rules about commitment. Still it doesn't detract a bit from the overall quality of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though the topic is not a fixed one to any era, the script does leave many oblique references to the Sixties in the film. The electroshock treatment and the lobotomy operations depicted here were by 1975 no longer in use. They were pretty barbaric and the mental health profession discarded these, but not before too many lives were shattered with them. One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest swept the main Oscar categories, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Actress for Louise Fletcher and Best Adapted Screenplay to Lawrence Hauban and Bo Goldman. Brad Dourif was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but he lost to George Burns in The Sunshine Boys.Louise Fletcher never got the career mileage she should have for playing Nurse Ratched. It took her years, but she did get another career role in television as the ruler of Bejor, Kai Winn on Star Trek Deep Space Nine.One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest is one timeless classic, it will be popular a millenia from now.",

            "text": "One of the early scenes in \"Pulp Fiction\" features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it's also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, \"Pulp Fiction\" wouldn't be \"Pulp Fiction.\" I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.It's no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won't pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. \"Pulp Fiction,\" is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or \"art about art.\" It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it's essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino's originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, \"Be cool and no one's going to get hurt,\" which is just the type of line you'd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren't just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia's statement to Vincent, \"That's when you know you've found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.\"What is the movie's purpose exactly? I'm not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn't just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it's a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.There's a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch's act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we're never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, it's hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really \"about\" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.",

The random chit chat between characters regarding obscure things might feel a waste of time as it doesn't move the plot. But Tarantino is a genius and he believes in character development more than plot development so these chats actually humanizes the characters a lot and makes them relatable and memorable(The absolute converse of Nolan). This movie is just a collection of wonderful scenes back to back from start to finish.. The movie is a must watch just for the awesome screenplay alone. To top it off all the actors arguably give their career best performance(think about it ,it is true) . And the ability of Tarantino to just create a really tense or ridiculous situation out of nowhere(like the psycho tribute scene with marsellus and butch which is so unexpected or that adrenaline shot scene) is just awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seats .So if you want an entertaining but clever movie this is the one you are looking for . It is funny, filled with some of the best dialogues ever ,superbly acted, great soundtracks(I just wanna see Tarantino's ipod , boy does he have great taste) and is just a spectacular experience.Spoilers ahead(duh):\nFor those of you who say the characters are hollow I suggest you to revisit the gold watch sequence. Walken's Capt Koons tells a story to young butch about how Butch's grandpa requested an enemy soldier to return his watch to his family and the soldier agreed. Similarly Butch could have left Marsellus but the legacy of his watch made him save him which I believe was a nice touch. And how Jules(one of my characters of all time) undergoes a change is also a noteworthy counter argument to the above mentioned criticism.Sorry for the huge review..",

When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines – it's a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it's just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there's the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with 'Pulp Fiction'. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of \"chapters\" – there is so much playful creativity at play here, it's just a pure joy to watch.If you're a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats – and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even \"stealing\" from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino's masterpiece today, it's impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it's got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it's such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It's – well: it's 'Pulp Fiction'. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.",

Because of the many \"f\" words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is \"cool\", he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about \"Pulp Fiction\"? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.",

Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.",

            "text": "Perhaps before I start talking about why I think Pulp Fiction works on so many levels, I should mention briefly how I came to watch the film. Pulp Fiction was a film I had heard of at a very young age, and I'm not quite sure why. I had also wanted to see it for a very long time- again, I'm not quite sure why. Maybe the mere fact that it was R-rated and notorious for its violence perked the interest of my 14-year-old self. Nevertheless, I got round to watching it about a month before my 15th birthday- incredibly late at night on an occasion where I found myself home alone. I recall being blown away by the film, but also somewhat overwhelmed and confused. I had never seen anything like it before, and walked away from it being kinda sure I'd enjoyed it. I couldn't say for sure though.Still feeling curious about the film, and the many mysteries relating to it that I'd failed to determine on my first viewing, I re-watched the film just a couple of months later. And something just clicked for me- I fell in love with the film. Everything about the movie suddenly worked for me, and I found the second viewing to be perhaps the shortest two and a half hours of my life I've ever experienced. My own sense of time was warped and bended to the extent that it was in the film itself. That very night it somehow became one of the greatest things I had ever watched; one of the only films I'd seen that I barely hesitated to call a masterpiece.Since then I've watched it another six or seven times- almost once a year- and I continue to feel motivated to watch it because I honestly feel like I get something new out of it each time I watch it.Spoilers ahead, by the way. I plan to get fairly in-depth with my review of this movie, so just a warning for those that haven't seen it.One of the great things about Pulp Fiction is its refusal to fall under any particular genre or category of movies. It feels like a comedy when Jules and Vince discuss fast food and foot massages for nearly ten minutes It feels like a thriller during several segments, notably the scene where Mia overdoses on heroin and the climactic Mexican stand-off in the restaurant- two sequences that would have even Alfred Hitchcock on the edge of his seat. The crime genre is represented through the character's actions- most of the cast are criminals in one way or another, whether they murder, steal, or take generous helpings of class-A drugs. The infamous gimp scene feels straight out of a horror movie.This collage of various movie genres is one of the things that makes the movie stand out- by themselves, certain scenes may feel familiar, but when they're all blended together so well like they are in Pulp Fiction, the end product ends up feeling unique. This is true for most of Quentin Tarantino's films- he borrows elements from different genres, and homages/ references dozens of older movies in order to create something that feels unique, even if most of the individual elements themselves aren't too original. I can see why some people may not be a fan of the fact Tarantino essentially steals from the lesser known works of those who came before him, but for me, I love it- I think he just makes it work due to the fact that his encyclopaedic knowledge of film allows him to borrow from so many sources. If he simply referenced about a half dozen or less films for each one of his movies, then I think that would start to feel like plagiarism.Now, I could go on about the acting, the screenplay, the direction, and the glorious soundtrack, but really, what's there to say about these elements of the film that haven't already been said? Tarantino's screenplay is one of the most acclaimed and quoted from the past couple of decades, and deservedly won him his first Oscar. His direction has been similarly praised, and the soundtrack has become iconic- most impressive of all is that Tarantino chose music that goes so well with the images they accompany. And yes, the acting is phenomenal- the film features what is almost certainly Samuel L. Jackson's best performance, one of Bruce Willis' most interesting performances of his long and successful career, and some great work from Uma Thurman. Even the supporting actors are memorable, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace (who's arguably the film's main character- think about it; without him, none of the three main stories would exist- Butch ripped off Marsellus Wallace, Vince took out Wallace's girlfriend on a date that eventually went horribly wrong, and Vince and Jules were assigned to retrieve the mysterious briefcase for Wallace). And of course, who can forget that Pulp Fiction single-handedly made John Travolta cool again- an absolutely monumental achievement. Of course Travolta did eventually succeed in making himself a joke again a few years later when he made Battlefield Earth, but that's another story (or perhaps better left for another review)?As I said, I could indulge in commenting on these areas of the film, but if you've seen the movie you probably already know how good they are. Pulp Fiction is also one of the most discussed film's of the past 20 years, so you've likely already come across reviews or rabid Tarantino fans who've gushed about why the film works so well, and how fantastic all the various components of the film are.So instead, I'm going to backtrack back to my point about seeing something new in the film upon every new viewing, and explain what I took away from the movie on my most recent viewing.Pulp Fiction was always controversial for its violence, with some criticising its depiction of assaults, shootings, beatings, and exploding heads. But for me, I found the film to have an almost anti-violence message of sorts, and I only realised this on my most recent viewing. Now bear with me, because I know that sounds like a somewhat ridiculous claim, but I have my reasons. Pulp Fiction may be violent, but it doesn't promote violence. Sure, the violence may be somewhat stylised and at times over the top, but that doesn't mean the film is saying that violence is something trivial. Violent acts in the film are often shown to have consequences for those that commit them. Vince's carelessness with his gun- an instrument of violence- causes Marvin's head to be blown off in the backseat of Jules' car, which leads to a near twenty minute detour in which they must take the car to Jimmy's house and consult \"The Wolf\" to assist them in cleaning the car and disposing of the gory evidence. Marsellus' desire to get revenge on Butch by presumably killing him leads them both to the basement of the rednecks- indeed, they are both fighting each other in the redneck's store when they are taken captive.But in the climax of the film, where guns are being pointed at several characters in the middle of a tense Mexican stand-off, not a single bullet is fired. One would expect the tension to be eventually broken and the bullets to start flying, especially if one has seen some of Taratino's other movies that end in explosive and violent climaxes (see Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds, Death Proof, Django Unchained, and Kill Bill Volume 1). But instead, Jules, who we've seen to be ruthless and unafraid to kill earlier in the movie, believes himself to be a changed man after miraculously surviving a hail-storm of bullets from a criminal that looks a little like Jerry Seinfeld and so instead decides to defuse the situation peacefully. He talks down Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny from killing or robbing anyone, and insists that his dim-witted associate Vince refrain from hurting anyone too. He delivers an absolutely stunning monologue where he ponders the bible reading he quoted so confidently earlier in the movie, and it's damn-near poetic. It sends a shiver up my spine every time I watch that scene, and indeed, Jules' speech works. The two robbers get up after Jules gives them some money from his famous wallet, and then leave. Jules and Vince do the same a few moments later.Not a shot is fired. No one is killed. It's an absolutely beautiful scene.It may have been tempting for Tarantino to give the film a \"Wild Bunch-esque\" ending, but instead he refrained, and I'm glad he did so. The climax to Pulp Fiction is absolutely stunning- fifteen minutes of tension, almost poetic dialogue, and brilliant acting, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. And it took me seven viewings just to notice how beautifully peaceful the ending of the film was. And that's why it's my favourite film of all time- I get new meaning from it, or appreciate different areas of it every-time I watch it.If you've never seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it.\nAnd if you have seen Pulp Fiction before, I implore you to go watch it again.",

But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage.

His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a \"tough guy\" image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. \"And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...\" is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is.

Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn't finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis' wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, that's the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It's a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can't get the story straight and have to keep going back: \"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . .\" I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don't think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that's why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don't fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It's like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when \"Shut the f*ck up, fat man!\" is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy.",

I think some of the \"Segments\" are a lot stronger than others. I think that the first part of Bruce Willis's story is just... bland. I didn't find it very interesting or compelling. It gets interesting though. The first and last are by far my favourite, but for the most part it's pretty strong. I do think this film is slightly overrated. That's not to say that it isn't good, but I think a lot of people think it is a whole lot better then it is. The film is acted well and I enjoyed all the action, not to mention the comedy in this film caught me by surprise. I found it really hilarious. I see why everyone had/has a crush on Uma Thurman now, she really is deserving of the main character on the cover. I also remembered how much I like long shots. I think they allow exposition to be delivered in a way that is more pleasing to the audience. Overall, good crime flick with some great comedy and action but a tad overrated. 7-8/10.",

            "text": "It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.",

            "text": "'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.",

He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene.

Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?

            "text": "The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about gangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.",

The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I'll give him an offer he can't refuse\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.",

            "text": "This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.",

I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox",

            "text": "\"The Godfather\" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching \"The Godfather,\" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, \"Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.\"That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, \"It's strictly business\" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a \"cold hearted bastard\" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like \"The Godfather,\" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.",

I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar.

It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film.",

            "text": "THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.",

            "text": "You can't really criticize a film like \"The Godfather\", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, \"The Godfather\" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen \"The Godfather\" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a \"Moustache\" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. \"The Godfather\" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words \"required viewings.\"",

I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.",

It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish.",

            "text": "`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.",

This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through.\nEven though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for.\nThat is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. \nThe imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. \nThe film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years.",

            "text": "In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.\nI have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history.",

Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured.

While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.",

            "text": "SPOILERS Three years after \"Star Wars\", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas's vision is better off for it. With it's recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it's original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original \"Star Wars\" because it isn't so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don't quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn't quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda's style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There's no real way to fault \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up \"Star Wars\", but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch. In this part though, Lucas didn't get involved and as a result, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is a masterpiece in it's own right.",

Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!",

            "text": "The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "rating": 9.9,
            "text": "(Note: This review contains some spoilers.)Movie novelty quickly wears thin, which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals. \"Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\" is the best of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film. Granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is a tiny inch ahead in the race.It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. Just take a look at \"Predator 2\" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script.The film generally picks up where the last left off: Luke (Mark Hamill) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (Carrie Fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. But Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) is still alive, and the Emperor's fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), an old pal of Han's who is secretly working for Vader, somewhat against his own will.The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors, just as the original. Luke is the savior, Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas, Han Solo is one of Luke's good disciples and Vader represents pure evil. And of course, there's the truly iconic line, \"I am your father,\" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer.\nLucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. Like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, \"Star Wars\" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. Yes, \"Star Wars\" is the quintessential nerd's film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved -- it's still a wonderful story, and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many).One of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the \"Star Wars\" phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is directed by Irvin Kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing \"RoboCop 2.\" How could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? Simple: Kirshner's darkness in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" had a point, and a high value. In \"RoboCop 2,\" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original \"RoboCop\" was something not many films can accomplish, and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three \"Star Wars\" movies. It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling Luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: The showdown with Vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed.The movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. From beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. All trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (\"Back to the Future Part II\" is a good example), yet in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. By the end of the movie, we know what Luke is feeling: There is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. For us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. For Luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away...5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

            "text": "The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+. The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star. Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with.This movie is directed by Irvin Kershner (Robocop 2) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Clear and Present Danger), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Nighthawks) and James Earl Jones (Coming to America).The Empire Strikes Back was always one of my favorites in the original trilogy. The opening yeti scene was fantastic and a great way tp start the film. The Princess and Hans scenes were hilarious and the banter makes you laugh no matter how many times you've seen it. Yoda is a legendary character introduced in this film and the Hans stasis scene is always sad. The final Luke vs Vader scene is also legendary and fun to watch unfold.Overall this is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see. This is an easy 10/10.",

How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following.Star Wars is an excellent intellectual property based on an excessively cheesy movie franchise. I feel similarly to the star wars franchise as I do the Marvel cinematic universe. They are a set of fun and entertaining family movies that can make your imagination go absolutely wild. I know I'm not alone in pretending that I was a Jedi or a Superhero when I was young. What the franchise is not is any sort of art film or strong statement about anything. It is pure fun, but perhaps better left in nostalgia than a film to come back to. As the weight of the visual technology fades, it is hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack are enough to carry it.Conclusion: wonderful IP and universe, very cheesy film.",

            "text": "I saw The Empire Strikes Back (TESB) when I was 13 or 14, and I didn't like it back then. I've seen it many times since, and in my later views I really wanted to like it, but I ended up disliking it even more. The first sign of silliness in my eyes was the snow-speeders equipped with harpoons and towing cables. Why should anyone install a harpoon to a flying machine? It turns out to topple AT-ATs. But how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? Well, they didn't. It dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling. Create the outcome first (tackle walking machines), invent how to generate it (using cables) later. And do it again, this time with Luke.Why did Luke flee the cave into the cold snow storm instead of killing the wampa? Because he had to come to the brink of death. And why is that? Because just before passing out he needs to see Obi-Wan's ghost. And what's it doing there? Obi-Wan's spirit is there to tell Luke where to find Yoda. Sorry but this is nonsense. First, the flow of the story is backwards, because at the time Luke leaves the cave, he has no reason to do so; he should have killed the wampa and stayed inside. Second, this part of the story must be about setting our main character in motion. Luke needs a motivation to pursue his Jedi training. One may argue that this must be the natural outcome of the first film. But still, Mr Lucas owes the viewer a decent sequence showing how Luke discovers where Yoda lives. The way Luke is informed of Dagobah in TESB is simply bad storytelling.That also leads to a hollow first act. The action in there has nothing to do with Luke's storyline. The Battle of Hoth is completely pointless. The first act must be all about sending Luke to Dagobah. Luke will go there anyway with or without this useless battle. But instead of watching Luke discover Yoda and Dagobah, we have to watch some silly battle.As a consequence, we have a first act disjointed from the rest of the film. The action is isolated from, and not related to, the further events. You can start watching the film 35 minutes into it, when Luke gives R2 the coordinates of the Dagobah system. There's nothing that makes sense before, explaining why Luke wants to finish his training, or how he knows where to go. For further study, compare this to how the story unfolds in A New Hope.Things don't go well in the second act either. The story forks, and I have the feeling that Mr Lucas didn't know what to do with Han Solo and Leia, and decided to hide them inside the stomach of a giant space eel. Luke in Dagobah scenes don't fare better. Luke is a pilot and is supposed to be top physical form. Why all the physical training? And it contradicts with what Yoda says: luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Actually the problem is deeper. Jedi training is obviously not well thought of. It may look impressive on paper, with stream of consciousness and the like, but all we see on screen is a guy running with a backpack full of rocks, or trying to levitate things around him.The film is sort of alright 75 minutes into it, after Yoda moves Luke's X-wing out of the swamp. But not enough to make it more than 4 stars out of 10. Don't forget that some of the things the fans pan in Return of the Jedi and in the prequels are present in TESB some way, though not as pronounced as in the prequels. I have to come back to that but the first act of The Empire Strikes Back is a disaster. I've tried to make objective points anyone could check for themselves, you like this film or not. If you think that TESB is flawless, please think twice.",

            "text": "My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them.",

            "text": "The fourth entry in the revitalised buddy cop, action, comedy franchise. Bad Boys: Ride or Die sees wisecracking Miami cops Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) embark on a dangerous mission to clear the name of their late police captain when he gets linked to drug cartels.Firstly, they missed a trick not calling this instalment Bad Boys 4 Life, alas we cannot have everything we desire. Anyway, it was inevitable that we were going to get a fourth (and potentially fifth) as 2020's actual Bad Boys For Life made nearly half a billion dollars and due to the pandemic, was in the top 3 highest grossing of that year.It has been too long since I watched the first film (it is long, long overdue a rewatch), however Bad Boys II I return to every couple of years when I require a dousing of Bayhem. Has it aged well? Nope. Is it obnoxious and overlong? Yes. Does the action rule? Hell yes! The third film I found solid, yet disappointing, it lacked the grit and sleaze of its predecessor and incorporated a bizarre supernatural element that didn't quite click.This was a real step up from three and balances the slick, modernised lega-sequel of the previous film with the sleaze and chaos of Bay's entries. Admittedly it's a little bit of a rushed and rocky start and narratively the film isn't bringing anything particularly new to the table, yet it's clearly relishing its heightened mid-00's vibes. Once Marcus returns a from death's embrace with a new outlook on life and spirituality and Mike's fears for his family, his own mortality and a reconnection with his fugitive son come to the forefront of his anxieties, the film adds a surprising layer of character work that still manages to incorporate dick jokes and f-bombs aplenty.Action-wise this boasts some of the franchise's best set pieces. Director's Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah certainly lean a bit heavier into the Bayism's here than in BBFL. A slow-motion, sped up and gloriously chaotic digital, neon tinged art exhibition shootout is very Bay. A superb John Wick-esque home invasion shootout (featuring a well deserved triumphant moment for a fan favourite character) and the *entire* finale section of the film is a bar setter for shootouts this year. The incorporation of first person POVs, drones, alligators, explosions aplenty mix together for a riotous bloody blowout.Performance-wise this was certainly the best way Will Smith could properly return after the Oscars controversy (I know he had Emancipation a few months after the incident, but I don't think anybody apart from me watched it). His more vulnerable and subdued fatherly moments as Mike are well executed... as well as the kick ass swagger that established the character. However, it's Martin Lawrence that steals the show. A motormouth, wide-eyed, born again foul mouthed spiritual guide who claims he can't die. He's having a ball and both he and Smith's chemistry is still unbeatable. Supporting players Jacob Scipio, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhea Seehorn and Reggie himself Dennis Greene are all locked in to the material.Bad Boys: Ride or Die was a bullet riddled, cackle worthy blast of throwback fun that was a step up from my expectations. Smith & Lawrence are still a great duo, the action is killer and the balance of soap opera sincerity and over-the-top drama balances effectively with the motor-mouthed bickering and gags. Sure, the plot isn't particularly standout and the film is a little choppy in the first act, but when the wheels begin to fully spin, the film charges off the start line.",

But the rest of the story was thrilling and connected to all the past bad boys films which I can appreciate it more for that, especially seeing the relationship between Mike and his son. Mike had some more character work with his panic attacks and even Marcus showing age and toll of the job they do. Final showdown was epic with tons of action with some really unique stuff to have fun with. Music they used too was really epic of course \"Bad Boys\" song but the song \"Tonight\" was really awesome and the use of those songs made it so much more amazing! Some really interesting camera angles especially during the final face off and as a wannabe cinematographer I appreciate them trying new things and seeing them work. It's good to see actors such as Rhea Seehorn, Eric Dane and Ioan Gruffudd in more roles too! There is also a Michael Bay cameo which was pretty cool! A great Bad Boys film that is epic on scale, hilarious and action packed fun!",

I enjoyed this movie but it offers nothing new it is just same as last film which I found amazing because 3rd one came after a very long time after 2nd one, but this time magic and charm don't work.. Chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is the real soul of these movies their comedy timing is perfect and they can still kick some ass even after 30 years.. Story was same as many other movies we've seen before good guys gets framed for something which they didn't do, they catch bad guys and defeat them. The End. There are some good action scenes in this movies mostly consists of shootouts ,I think 2nd one has the best action sequences because that was directed by Michael Bay who is known for making big scale action pieces, after some time you'll get bored seeing same action again and again but it was still very fun to see on big screen especially the FPS gun scene during climax.. Cinematography consisting of Skylines shots of Miami was cool to see, soundtrack was good and acting of man leads was the best part of movie...\nOverall I enjoyed this movie as a Summer popcorn flick, if you love action comedies with some of the old famous actors of Hollywood you should catch it on big screen. You will enjoy it..",

It maybe also has to do with the fact that this was the first Bad Boys movie I've watched in the big screen, naturally making the experience more exciting and memorable, but I also feel like the movie has a lot to make it likeable - be it the rather cliché but effective script, the callbacks, the action, the excitement and most of all, the amazing chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Overall, the movie is pretty fun and while not all jokes land, it's still decently funny and entertaining at the same time.",

Where the third introduced this bazaar soap opera styled movie with a witch and a long lost son, this one they introduce.... god? And soul mates..... its funny I completely missed the warlock and demons in the first and second film.I genuinely hope this movie makes enough money to fund a 5th film just so they can afford Michael bay and some decent writers! Because I love seeing Will and Martin together and the characters (at least the OG version of them were so great). Why have they made Marcus SOOO dumb... it didn't work for Thor love and thunder and it doesn't work here.The directors need to quit and just work for MTV it's genuinely like they have never seen the first two films and have only HEARD about Bay's style of directing. Just because you can fit a camera in a seemingly impossible position doesn't mean you should do it every 3 minutes. Every shot and scene in this film is just flooding with an attempt to be stylish or cool or bay-esc. The camera is constantly spinning or moving it makes Bay's shaky cam feel like a tripod. Also what's with ALL the colour/neon!? Every close up I swear has either a red, green or purple glow to it; unless it's interior, in which case you are treated to over the top lens flare from curtain less windows. The OG films looked beautiful but also had some grit to them.Point is I am a fan so wanted to like it but it didn't look good, it wasn't funny and it just felt like the franchise is going the same direction as fast and the furious but some how less entertaining.The last two films have been a crime to cinema, how they got Will and Martin to sign their contracts I will never know.How two thirds of this film was ever put on the page, I will never know. It felt like a straight to DVD waste of time.",

            "text": "It's been four years since we were allowed to see the last Bad Boys film. To everyone's delay, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence returned as agents Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnet. Of course, the first mentioned was discredited at the 2022 Oscar ceremony, after he sold actor Chris Rock a bang for his head after making a joke by his wife. Because the whole world spoke of shame about this, it became a bit quiet around Smith and he has done little more. This fourth Bad Boys film should give his career a big boost again and time will tell if the world has already forgiven Will Smith. In my case, I never blamed him for anything and I thought it was all very exaggerated how everyone reacted. I have always found Smith a good and above all nice actor and nothing has changed at all to date. The third Bad Boys For Life from 2020 is nice, but didn't manage to hit the level of the first two films, I expect the same from this fourth part and that's fine, because this will be a lot of action and humor where entertainment is guaranteed.And that's it, Bad Boys: Ride or Die gives exactly what you expect in advance and offers a tight two hours of pure popcorn entertainment. The film opens with a bickering Mike and Marcus. Marcus has to live healthier for his health, but when the two with screeching tires race across the highway, Marcus really wants to get something to drink. He gets 85 seconds, where Marcus seizes this moment to buy a hot dog and war Skittels within that time, but then the case is robbed. When Mike furiously walks into the case, a gun is immediately pointed at him, but Mike immediately starts whining at Marcus about his eating behavior. Bam! Opening film, something that immediately leaves its mark on the rest of the film. The gradient just fits perfectly with the predecessors and the directors on duty know how to make the course go as it should. Perhaps a point of criticism is the rather dynamic camera work. You may not really realize this at the beginning of the movie, but when the big action scenes come, it sometimes works disturbingly. Especially in the big end fight, where switching to a first person shooter mode, it looks rather cheap shooting. This was already shown in a making off, in which Smith controlled the image with his movements with a camera around his waist or on his arm.The movie is really full of spectacular action and it's impossible for you to get bored. When Mike and Marcus try to purge the name of their deceased chief commissioner, they are forced to work with the captured Armando, son of Mike of course and bad guy in the previous film. Armando is the only one who can identify who is behind the plot. Unfortunately, the shoe is a bit pinching there, because although the writers may have tried to keep the story mysterious where the outcomes should amaze the viewer, the course and the outcome is very predictable and that is a shame. You will actually know quite quickly how or what in the 'trust no one' cat-en-mouse game where you eventually get stuck with a 'see' feeling. That's quite a shame, because this could perhaps have been prevented with some better writing, where you would still have a reasonable surprise to expect, but none of that. You actually see this very often in these kinds of films and of course you don't go there for a heavy plot twist where your mouth falls open, but here a very easy way is chosen to stay honest. Does that affect the film a lot for the rest? No, because as indicated earlier, you just get what you want and what you expect.Bad Boys: Ride or Die is already the fourth film in the series and gives you as a viewer exactly what you expect from it. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are the bickering police duo again and end up in an explosive situation again. Perhaps a little more attention should have been paid to the story itself, because that is very predictable, but well, because you are constantly entertained, a large part of the audience will be a concern. However, the camera work is sometimes just a little too dynamic, making some things difficult to follow. For the rest, this is just popcorn entertainment from the top shelf and as mentioned you just get what you come for, a lot of fun humor with action, action and more action. If the Belgian directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi continue to do this, they can still make a few films, because this is just wonderful set your mind on blanc and just watch and enjoy without fuss or other difficult hassle.",

That came with a bunch of side characters new and old and an okay plot but there is one thing that lets this movie down and it's Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett.Unfortunately, it's becoming all too common in Hollywood for a character to be so over the top for a movie that it just becomes distracting.After surviving a near death experience at the beginning of the film, Marcus is high on life and he literally acts as if he is high for the rest of the film. This went beyond fun and playful to the point where it was distracting and annoying. It led to many frustrating scenes which felt like they belonged in a cartoon including one scene where the characters chose one of the worst possible moments to sing the Bad Boys theme.In the End, Bad Boys Ride or Die is a frustrating but okay film which could have been much better with different narrative choices although many people might enjoy the direction that the film went.",

A portion of them are useless.Cinematography: This film emphasizes the use of cameras. Particularly in the action scenes. Not that awful, actually.Acting: Will's entertaining dialogues aren't all that memorable, and his acting is lifeless. Several times, Martin has overacted. That could be the characterization, I don't know. However, something is absent.Editing: The hue and lighting aren't very appealing. VFX and blue screen are provided as usual. For the huge screen, some effects are quite unique. It's interesting to watch fight scenes with musical accompaniment.Stunt: As long as there is minimal usage of blue screens, the stunts in this film are good.Soundtrack: It's alright. The stunt scenes' background music is well-done.Attraction: To put it simply, the Bad Boys movie's entertainment value is \"okay.\" It is not a thrilling, suspenseful action film.

However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,\"I think it is a little bit of both.\" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!",

As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice \"You can sit here if you want\". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's \"always kissing and touching her and her sisters\". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest \"Run, Forrest! Run!\". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, \"Forrest Gump\" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10",

Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",

As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",

First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous.

I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world.

It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, \"The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.\" How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",

I don't have any complaints about the movie, in terms of cinematography, actors, or premise/theme. This review is about a specific character. That character is Jenny.I strongly dislike Jenny and now I will go into detail.Let me start out by saying, the way they wrote her character is oddly realistic in my opinion and that's part of the reason I have any judgement about her at all. As a teen (first time I saw the movie), I didn't understand why Jenny was so reckless, but now I understand that it stems from her childhood.However, this is where it begins fumbling for me. Jenny went to college. This means that she has an understanding that hard-work and effort will bring some form of success. With that being said, it VEXES me how she treats Forest. She treats him horribly. She does not owe him anything in the first place, so her constant toxic, recurring and random appearances in his life are exactly that.After meeting so many men that treated her bad, you would think she would have given him an actual chance earlier on. Forest, although \"mentally challenged\" had about the same understanding about the world around him as any other male his age. He was well-built and attractive, and conversational. It makes sense, in an aspect, that because she was abused; she constantly searches for comfort in men that hurt or abuse her. It also doesn't, because again, she went to college. She had in her mind that she owed herself more, and then gives that away.Whether directly or indirectly, she's manipulating Forest throughout the movie and this is supported by her eventually having a child with him. Why have a child with someone you don't take seriously UNLESS you feel like they are benefitting you in some aspect? It's frustrating to watch her take advantage of his simple mind. She knows what she's doing. She's operating on a level, he can't comprehend, which is again -manipulation.She has no sense of self, and apparently no empathy either. If being abused has caused her to seek negative partners, behave dangerously, and more; then why would she constantly push her way into Forest's life at random times? And if she's behaving unconsciously, with no intentions (or unknowingly) because she was abused, then why is she able to spend time with other people and give them her quality time?Jenny is a careless, and a bit of a heartless individual, and her character irritates me off.",

Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or \"destiny\" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made. Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us \"You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!\" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind.

When I am reading through fellow user reviews, I generally find myself gravitating towards reading reviews that hold the opposite of my opinion. If I loved a film, I read the poor reviews and vice versa on the films that didn't resonate with me. I like finding value in an opposite viewpoint.With that said, while I read through the negative reviews of Forrest Gump, I found myself thinking that a number of the reviewers might be missing what I see is a large part of the film's message.Their focus was on the characters' intelligence and lifestyle. I read things like the point of the film was that you would be successful even if you're an idiot like Forrest, as long as you walked a conservative path. If you decided to take the path Jenny's character chose, despite the fact she was more intelligent than Forest, your life would end in disaster.I think the differences between Forrest and Jenny's journeys has nothing to do with the disparity in their intelligence or lifestyle but more with the difference between someone who knows who he truly is versus someone who is searching to find out who they are.I don't think the movie is passing judgement on either person's choices. I don't see Jenny's life ending the way it does as being a failure. Her life had value and she was able to find what she was looking for. Forrest's life was incredible and his love for Jenny was his guiding star. He lived through so many experiences and met so many famous people of that era. He lucked into wealth and at a couple points in the film became famous in his own right. None of that had any real meaning to him. His purpose came from his personal relationships, protecting and doing right by those he loved and his strong sense of right and wrong.Each character's journey (again regardless of intelligence) is representative of the experiences of an entire generation of North Americans.",

Mind-boggling Oscar-winning computerized effects by Industrial Light & Magic has Gump meeting the famous and infamous. Hanks is a wonder (dare you not to get a lump in your throat when it finally registers that he has a child {yes, that's Haley Joel Osment}- watch his face!) and gets fine support especially Wright as the love of his life and Sinise as his best friend (Best Supporting Actor nominee) superior adaptation of Winston Groom's novel by Eric Roth (also an Academy Award recepient) that truly captures lightning in a bottle. Oscars also went to director Robert Zemeckis and for Best Picture. *** One of my all-time favorite flicks. I still cry, particularly Forrest telling Jenny why he loves her so much (\"You're my girl!\") and at the gravesite when the birds fly overhead.",

The cinematography is stunning, the costumes are lovely and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also very calm and relaxing, perhaps adding to the tone of this film. The screenplay is well crafted, and the story is simple. But what made this movie was its simplicity; it never tries to be too complex and is consequently moving. The acting is just as impressive; whilst Tom Hanks's accent is a little awkward in places, my only real criticism of this movie, he gives a truly remarkable performance, though I do think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar more for Shawshank. Robin Wright gives possibly the best performance of her career, and Sally Field is very dignified as Forrest's mother. The scene stealer though is Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, a very moving and insightful performance. Overall, an extremely good movie, I will admit I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but the simple answer is this, I do. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It's beyond anything i can explain. The closest word would be perfection, but that doesn't even do it justice.I was 11 when the first movie came out, and i fell in love with the franchise immediately. Everything i did revolved around the fantasy universe as this franchise was the first big thing i truly fell in love with. I have pictures of elves on my walls and dragon statues on my shelfs. I have Sting hanging on my wall and my key chain for my car keys is the One Ring. My wife has the evening star and she wore it at our wedding. Lord of the rings has made me to who i am today and i feel privileged to have such a masterpiece be created in my short span on this earth!I love Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers, but Return of the King is the final piece that brings everything together. I'm usually a pretty tough guy, and i rarely get emotional but the last hour is hard for me to sit through without shedding a tear. No matter how many times i watch the franchise i always get emotional. \"My friends. You bow to no one!\" gets me every time!The last thing I'd like to ad is that i feel like I'm a part of the journey. I feel sorta empty after watching it. I feel like all of the hobbits when they come back home and drinks their first pints at The Green Dragon. It's one of the movies where i sit through the end credits and just think.

Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.\"Return of the King\" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.A masterpiece, whether as part of a bigger whole or on its own.

He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books, and after coming away from the final chapter, how does this rate not only as a film on its own, but as a part of the whole?Perfect.I've never seen a series like this.  A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you can't help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible?  I have always loved the original \"Star Wars\" and \"Indiana Jones\" series for their epic storytelling, and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be, will be, remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come.  They do not make films like these anymore.As a stand alone film, it picks up immediately where \"Two Towers\" ends, so brush up before seeing it.  I've read the books, and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective.  I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done \"right\".  And when it happened, it was.  I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.The cast comes through once more.  The musical score retains its beauty, elegance and power.  The special effects, notably Gollum again, are nothing less than breathtaking, and simply move the story along.  The battles are monumentally huge and exciting.  There are some liberties taken with the story, especially during the end with the homecoming, and yet, everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself, the story provided a breather.  And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years.  It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no \"Rings\" movie in 2004.  I will miss this talented group of actors.As with the first two, the film is very long, but goes by without you ever truly realizing it.  This film is so much more than a simple \"fantasy\" epic. It's a story about strength of character, friendship, loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play, I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. It's his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory.  Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic.  As as far as the ending goes, they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been.I will miss looking forward to a new \"Rings\" movie, but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story, bathroom humor, or a \"Top 40\" soundtrack.  George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fanbase.Each film has earned a \"10\" from me for the last two years, which for me to give is a rarity.  This one, however, is as equally deserving as its two predecessors.  The Academy had better not look over this film for \"Best Picture\" of 2003.  To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.",

The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.At this point everyone has come to know and love all of the characters, and the stakes have become tremendously high. Kingdoms are at their knees, and the only two characters who can save the day are getting weaker and weaker. The tension was very high in this episode and I can honestly say that out of all 3 this was the only one that had me on the edge of my seat. There were many memorable scenes (one of my favourites including the part with the giant spider)that made this the classic that it is sure to stay for decades to come.This is the longest of the series, mostly because of the ending that seems to last a while. This was a good ending, and I can see why Frodo did what he did. He, and us the audience, have gone through an incredible ordeal and I think we needed that 20 minute linger. When the battle is over, and the celebrations have ended, there is a sad emptiness felt. The films spanned over 3 years, there have been the extended cuts of course, but after that, it's all over. Peter Jackson gave us an ending that was both appropriate and admirable.These were some amazing movies and this one in particular is the best, in my opinion. As whole, the Lord Of The Rings is a phenomenon. An absolute phenomenon. Much more than just movies. They have a universal appeal and have touched the hearts and imaginations of millions. I'm one of them.Sorry if I'm being all fanboyish and kissing this movie's ass, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favourites but generally this seems to be the movie event of the century. There will never be another Lord of the Rings film, and that's a bit depressing.My rating: 10/10",

I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters, but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring.My only slight disappointment is the ending, it does feel overlong and bloated for me, almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said, what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot, the marvellous score and the performance of Gollum.Despite this minor discrepancy, Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jackson's direction is very impressive here, and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made, but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing, the scenery is superb, the costumes and make-up are well tailored, the effects are superb and don't distract too much and the lighting is authentic.The score is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal, rousing, haunting and charming themes, whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm, darkness, etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship, strength and loyalty, the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging, Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in.The acting is very good. Orlando Bloom(who I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland) and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well, and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture, and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast, while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman, but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result.All in all, an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "text": "The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is by far the most moving, inspirational and epic of the three parts in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece. After proving that this trilogy can carry the weight of a truly enormous body of text with The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers, Jackson has shown that nothing is impossible anymore when being brought to film, and that fantasy can be surreal, but grounded to reality.I saw this film at 8:00 PM, and missed school the following day -- exactly similar to The Two Towers when it was released. After seeing The Return of the King I was speechless. Never before had a film made such an impact on me as this conclusion did, and now with it completed, The Lord of the Rings is truly the best of the best.Jackson has treated this trilogy as one film, following to Tolkien's linear time-line, and not the way the books were written, which makes this a film that flows and never loses track of pacing. The dialogue is emotional, be it the speech between Gandalf and Pippin before the gates of Minas Tirith, or inspirational, such as the rousing deliveries by Theoden and Aragorn. The vast emotion makes this a film for the ages. Following our heroes adventure since film one, we have grown compassion for each and everyone of them. Sam's devotion to Frodo is something that can inspire, and the eu-catastrophe is fully used here once again, because just as it seems that all hope has been lost, it shines through the void and victory is achieved. If one were to fear that the ending would feel like there was no closure, then have none, because The Return of the King has a 20-minute denouement that goes as far as four-years into the future, and the ending on the shores of the Grey Havens brought me to tears.The special effects are nothing short of amazing. The blend of miniatures/bigatures and CGI is believable beyond comprehension, and the addition of New Zealand locales adds something beyond some peoples' wildest dreams. The level of detail on Minas Tirith is something no one has ever seen before, the massive armies sunder speakers as war erupts, and we see the Mumakil and the Fell Beasts in full fruition, as hinted in The Two Towers. What could've seem fatal, as cinematic history has shown before, is the introduction of Shelob the spider. The special effects team has created the most memorable spider in film history. She terrifies and drops jaws at the realism of such a beast.The tension for the siege on Minas Tirith is so highly anticipated, that the filmmakers have completely satisfied every expectation to how epic it could've been. The scope is just extraordinary. The battle of the Pelennor Fields is so huge in the book, yet it has been fully realized in Jackson's film. The final stand at the Black Gate is so emotional involving, it's hard to think that any action could top what was previously seen, but it is done so with vision beyond imagination.Howard Shore's music is also some of the most impressive and beautiful orchestration ever done for film. Besting its predecessors, The Return of the King's score is pure genius. From the new theme for Gondor, to the moving Into the West, Shore's composition sweeps and soars. Now that each of the three films' complete recordings have been released, I strongly urge a fan of the music to buy them, because they really are the best of the best.The acting even surpasses the first two, having the evolution of each character add to the dramatic effect, be it the loss of a life, or the triumph over evil. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is like a Godsend. Sean Astin steals nearly every scene he is in as Sam, making us hope he helps Frodo get rid of the Ring of Power. Once again, Andy Serkis provides a stirring and great performance as Smeagol/Gollum. The full weight of the Ring is realized in this film, and Elijah Wood makes us see his struggle like the Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers only hinted upon.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King is remarkable. The battles are amazing, never making the film drag, and always heightening the tension. From the acting to the sound editing, this film delivers in what it promises, and that is the supreme motion picture of our lifetime, and many more years to come.",

The orcs think they get some backup when they see the black sails, but then are overrun by Aragorn, not the ghosts.Like the thing above there are more things which i do not like. Like the snowboarding Legolas in the battle for Helm's Deep (not this movie, but still). Legolas is indeed quite handy on his feet, but snowboarding on a shield? These are just the things which made me personally think Peter could have come up with a much better movie of one of the best story's ever written.",

            "text": "This review may contain minor spoilers.There is almost no use in viewing a movie, and merely minutes or hours afterwards rate what one have seen. It is easy to be affected by the first visual impact, and forget much else. When we rate a movie we do not only rate this visual impact, but also story, development, scenery, emotion, cinematography, effects, acting, and lots of other parameters. There has now been some time for me to ponder about my opinion on this movie, and compare it to other movies. I am very picky about them. In this review I will try to explain why this movie falls short, as does many other movies in the same category, and also explain why less is more.The third installment of The Lords of the Ring, called The Return of the King, is the last movie in a trilogy, based on the books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Now, I would prefer to call this a movie based on characters created by Tolkien, because in an adaption of a book, no changes in story can really be made. As another reviewer put it, a director can choose freely in filming parts of a work by Shakespear, but it would be absolutely out of the question for the director to add scenes or change the story to his own liking. Could anyone imagine MacBeth being proclaimed the King of Ireland, and not order the killing of his best friend, just because a director thought it would be a tad nicer? Peter Jackson though, seem to have no problem in doing just that with the works of Tolkien.Less is more. In The Return of the King, we are constantly being shown the obvious, in excess. Nothing is really left for the viewer to imagine for himself. The fall of evil (which by the way is a character we know almost nothing about) and the dark powers are shown with the explosion of a volcano, the crumbling of a tower and the utter cave-in of an entire domain. All this is obviously to state the already obvious - evil has fallen. Nothing is left for the viewers own imagination. I believe this is the real shortcoming of computer graphics. Since everything is possible to visualise, that is what is done. Back in the old days filmmakers had to rely on imagination, invention, and mere camerawork to create suspense. Nowadays we get all the readymade visuals rubbed in our faces. In great detail. One does no longer need imagination when going to the huge budget movies.The acting is also one-, or at best, two-dimensional. The acting and actors are, in many cases, only used to make simple statements about the story. Everything is telegraphed in advance, from \"this is an evil character\", to \"I am in doubt\", and \"He is brave\". In clean-cut, simple storylines, there are simply no room for surprises. Even the good versus evil is reduced to good characters only doing good things, and evil characters evil things. In that way the viewer never have to think for himself. One never have to ponder the question \"What is this persons true intentions?\". I find this over-simplification of characters and acting dull. In The Return of the King, there are plenty of it.Direction in this movie overuse slowmotion, close-ups, and special effects. One could liken this to a chef building towers of beautiful decorations and details on a dinner plate, but forgetting about the overall taste of the food. Many times, the most delicious and inspiring plate is the one with only a few ingredients, but cooked and served with care and skill. This is what differs Peter Jackson from great directors such as Fellini or Tornatore. Less is more. The music score is also a disappointment. If one wants to create epic adventure movies, the music score is very important. In this case Return of the King falls short of movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones where anyone can remember and even whistle the scores by heart, or the achievements and contributions to movies of composers like Ennio Morricone. They are great examples of when emotion is picked up and carried by the music. Even now, I cannot remember a single melody from The Return of the King. The music was drowned out by the overly use of special effects. Last time I saw this happen it was in the Matrix movies.To come to a conclusion about this movie, it would be that it is a great movie in special effects and grand scenery, but apart from that it is like going to the nearest fast food restaurant to get ones belly stuffed. The only scene that really stuck with me was the lone song in the great hall while the riders set out to their doom. Actually it was the only true scene I can remember where some was left for the viewers own imagination.A big budget and special effects does not automatically make a good movie.",

            "text": "Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden (Bernard Hill), the king of Rohan, and the elves, the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor, controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor, the last free kingdom of men, and the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) must warn Denethor (John Noble), Steward of Gondor of the impending attack, while Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), heir to the throne of Gondor, and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth, and two hobbits, Frodo (Elijah Wood) the ring-bearer and Sam (Sean Astin), must continue their journey, directed by Gollum, to Mount Doom, the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that? If not, you need to bone up on your `Lord of the Rings' before expecting to follow this film.Since all three epics were filmed simultaneously, each individually has the feel of being part of a larger picture - except for this one. `The Return of the King' is just too big, the most epic of a set of epic films. Now that director Peter Jackson has brilliantly constructed the characters and plotlines throughout the first two films, he puts them to use.All of the characters have their best moments within this film. The pair of mischievous hobbits, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), are no longer the tree ornaments they were from `Two Towers,' but are split-up, and take their characters in completely new directions. Aragorn, played with an unmatched sense of honor by Viggo Mortenson, is about to meet his destiny as the future king of all men, while Andy Serkis continues his expert portrayal of Gollum (Serkis' provided not only the voice of Gollum, but also assisted during production by acting out the scenes of the computer-generated character with his fellow actors).However, the real acting triumph of the film is Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins. He continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off. Wood's performance is so critical to the film because it determines the ring's power to corrupt, which, needless to say, is absolute.The first two films established Jackson as an incredible visionary, shooting vast landscapes from his native New Zealand. With `Return of the King,' Jackson really gets a chance to show off. With, hands down, the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy, Jackson makes `Return of the King' a gorgeous feast for the eyes, while never resorting to McG level over-the-topness. Jackson stays very grounded in his characters, not letting the effects tell the story, but only assist the wonderful dialogue and characters. Think of `Return' as a mix of `Fellowship' and `Two Towers,' with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude.The bottom line, fans of the films will not be disappointed. Hardcore Tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by Jackson and the other writers, however, it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels, being that film is an entirely different medium. Despite the alterations, Jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text, while adding some of the finest filmmaking ever put to screen. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made. Not only the best of the trilogy, but a crowning achievement in epic filmmaking.",

            "text": "I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied \"The Lord of the Rings\" though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.",

It's a trait that in recent years has sadly driven me away from most big budget American films. A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.We all saw the catastophre of a failure that arose from the Matrix Franchise. Such immense hype and professed genius only made the failure all the more poignant for those of us that really wanted and expected more from the franchise.That all being said, I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created.The 7 hours of film that leads up to the Return of the King is only precursor though, when you sit and watch this film. It's just plain brilliance. Everything about the film is wonderful. The manner in which Jackson has arranged the scenes, detracting slightly from the original flow of the novel really helps to keep the suspense strong in all three story branches. The Tolkien humor is intact perfectly and the gallantry and just plain coolness of these heroes is plain amazing. (Check out Legolas in the BIG battle) It's all just too much for words.If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I personally believe that this is the only way such a film could be made, true to the source material and completely engrossing, but I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after 4 hours (including ads and previews) that I had spent in a cramped seat. As such, this will be all the better (at least for me) when it's release on DVD (can't wait for the extended...get to see the Sauroman scenes that they cut out).As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jackson.",

I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.",

This time, Jackson followed Tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. It's a real shame we didn't get to see Christopher Lee in this move; he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the \"extended\" version isn't right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said, all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them.

Click on my screen-name and hit \"Chronological\" to view my reviews of the Fellowship and Two Towers. I make no guarantees about the quality and consistence of my review, but I do guarantee that these three films offer very high and very consistent quality from beginning to end. The acting, cinematography, art, and direction simply can not be beat.Which of the three movies is my favorite varies with my mood  and the same holds true for Tolkien's books. When I am immersed in the story, ROTK is my favorite. When I simply want to have fun with the whole experience, I love Fellowship. And when I want something intense, evocative and thoughtful, I go for the Two Towers.Frodo, Sam and Golem are on their way to Mount Doom and their bodies, nerves, and relationships have borne the greatest burden on middle earth. The rest of the fellowship is rallying to the defense of Minas Tirith, and preparing for even more deadly battles to come.The heroism and romance are incredibly moving - when was the last time you saw an entire audience leaving a theater after a fantasy movie rubbing their eyes? The sets are breathtaking - even moreso than in the previous two films.The casting and acting are superb.The film delivers at every level and is the jewel in the trilogy's well-earned crown.Return of the King offers a resolution of all of the major story arcs in LOTR. As with the classic Tolkien trilogy, however, you may be able to predict some of what will occur, but never all of it and you'll never guess how you will get there. The same fatalistic and paradoxically unpredictable feeling of Tolkien's grand plots is present throughout ROTK especially. The major theme in ROTK, however, is the varied ways and means of heroism  both intentional and unintended, and Tolkien's examination of sacrifice and heroism is as inspiring as it is subtle. Amazingly, it all comes through in the films.Even more than the previous two films, Jackson and his writers took liberties with the story-line. Like the others, however, this serves the film better than simple adaptation from one medium to another. By reordering some of the chronology and adding scenes and plot devices which are consistent with Tolkien's world and characterizations, the film-makers actually do a better job of preserving the concepts and themes of the story than they could have with a pure adaptation. The lengthy epilogue in Tolkien's book is greatly reduced, reordered, and somewhat changed in order to work in the film. Some parts actually appear very early in ROTK. And some aspects of Tolkien's epilogue are disclosed in the Two Towers, though not directly depicted. But all of the really important components of the epilogue are, at least strongly implied if not well illustrated in ROTK.",

Now we realise that the first two movies in this series were just the build up to this epic of a film. A masterful masterpiece, a flawless work of cinema whose only fault is that it seems too short. I don't have much to say about this; I don't want to spoil anything. But this is the big one. It completely blows the other two great movies out of the water. Suddenly, everything is more adult, more dramatic, and ten times the emotion. You could call it an emotional roller-coaster ride; certainly Jackson touches the nerves and heart-strings on more than one occasion.The centrepiece of the film is the battle for Minas Tirith, a huge war scene which features amazing special effects unlike anything ever seen before. An army of 300,000 riders on the heroes who defend their city with courage and spirit. Dragons fly down from the sky, huge boulders are tossed back and forth, and an army of trolls and oliphants are sent in to obliterate the heroes. Everything is dark and gruesome; Jackson reveals his origins by including many graphic and gruesome deaths which somehow make the 12A certificate a bit of a joke. Men are decapitated, crushed, impaled, and burnt. Heads fly over city walls and the viewer just sits and gapes at the magnificence of it all.The casting is excellent. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen come into their own. Billy Boyd is given serious stuff to deal with now, not just comic relief: his singing over the death of the soldiers is extremely moving and a stand against all generals who sit back and send their men to certain death. Miranda Otto comes into her own. The new character of Denethor is great, just as in the book. Legolas and Gimli are still there, although on the sidelines as always. But the real emotion comes from Elijah Wood and Sean Astin: this pair are brilliant, and their final journey to Mount Doom will bring tears to anybody's eyes through the heartache involved. Gollum is a force to be reckoned with this time and cannot be forgotten.After the slow build-up of the initial hour, things explode in cinematic heaven. The battles are amazing, topped by the arrival of the ghost army, sheer brilliance. Shelob is a wonderful special effect and extremely frightening. There is so much to love and thankfully the powerhouse ending doesn't disappoint. The only problem with this film is that it properly ends about 30 minutes before the credits, and Jackson fills the final 30 minutes with endless mawkish sentimentality which becomes truly sickening. Sadly, it doesn't spoil what's come before; I just tune out at this part.",

While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office.

Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.",

Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",

            "text": "In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.\"",

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",

            "text": "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",

The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",

You know the type  - like \"Dances with Wolves.\" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, \"Nothing to Lose\" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause \"that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank.\" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying \"you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all.\" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called \"The Dead Psychologist\" or Citizen Kane was called \"The Sled\" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is \"slow\" or \"moves at its own pace\" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!",

            "text": "Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?",

When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!",

            "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10",

Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect.

I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, \"The Godfather\" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like \"On The Waterfront\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's \"Cool Hand Luke\", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.",

When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a \"Rocky\"-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.",

            "text": "An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - \"this is not an exact science\") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.",

I think a lot of people think the film is about an innocent man being freed by a jury that was initially hobbled by prejudice and vindictiveness. I.e. Juror #10 is a bigot, Juror #3 was trying to convict because of personal demons around his son. That is the first impression the film gives. But the film is a lot more nuanced than that. Instead, the film is about a man-who probably did commit the crime-being freed because the state failed to met its evidential burden. The first take on the film is a moral polemic, the second take is compelling legal drama.Juror #4-the calm, always reasonable and engaged stockbroker brought to life by e.g. Marshall-is where the second take comes from in my mind. Had every single juror who was in the \"guilty\" camp to the bitter end been bigoted, unreasonable the film would be poorer for it. Instead Juror #4 *sincerely* believes in the defendants' guilt *until* the core of the case is dealt with. I.e. The eye witness. The character is the best arguer and while he is clearly engaged by the proceedings he is not emotional, personal. Juror #4 is the best juror qua juror because he demonstrates the virtue of reasonableness. This character is why the final film is so great and nuanced.While Juror #8 is the hero of *this* story Juror #4 is the model we should strive to follow if called to serve.",

What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.",

Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.

            "text": "'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.Several of the stars of '12 Angry Men' became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in 'The Virginian'. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the 'Kennedy' mini-series. Jack Klugman was 'Quincy' whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the 'Winnie The Pooh' films and cartoons.Of the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!(*John Fiedler died June 2005. Jack Warden died July 2006.)",

The late 90's TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating's sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?There could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer's attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY'S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant's guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very \"ordinariness\" is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they're all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how \"truth\" can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda's role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?This is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide.

            "text": "Theater at its best is practically impossible to get down on film correctly. When Hollywood gets it right, they create a work of art. In this case, they did it simply, without frills, casting actors who looked real and fell into their individual parts like kids into a swimming pool on a hot summers day. It's the hottest day of the year, and these twelve men must decide the fate of an accused killer. But twelve men means twelve personalities, twelve temperaments, twelve political views, twelve religious opinions and twelve preconceived notions. As the temperature swells, so does the temperament. Having been a very reluctant jury foreman, I find myself seeing eye to eye with the shyness of the man forced to lead the proceedings. Everybody looks at you to get the ball rolling and hopefully get out of there as quickly as possible. Martin Balsam, as the foreman, tries to remain dignified and not be overly in control, losing that to one of the jurors who looks at the case in a completely different way than the others. Twelve personalities means plenty of neuroses, and in a very short time, seeing what's really going on in the minds of strangers whom you'll never see again.This trial involves young John Sacova, accused of killing his own father, and the twelve men must decide whether he gets the chair or not. These men, only identified through their juror number, are completely different, and it's obvious from the start that some of them (John Fiedler in particular) vote guilty because they think they have to. Only one (Henry Fonda) votes not guilty, and of course, one of them says, \"There's always one.\" There are the aggressive ones certain of guilt, empathetic ones who would like to see the charges reduced, and those who view all young people from certain areas as scum regardless of their situation. At 60 years old, this film shows the same prejudices we face today, yet shows that there is always someone not about to follow the crowd simply because something strikes them as off. It is Fonda who will pretty much control the room, although he does it in a subtle way where nobody realizes that he's pretty much taken over.While jury's have changed in 60 years (allowing women to serve being the most obvious change), what hasn't changed in the conflict of trying to understand the truth and to agree with 11 other people about it. Fonda goes against what would be allowed today by acting on his own and visiting the neighborhood of the crime, but his passion in figuring out the truth is very admirable. He is quiet in his determination, making this typical Fonda but one that fills his soul with humility and integrity.Under the direction of novice Sidney Lumet, the entire cast is outstanding. Familiar faces from all walks of show business each get their chance to shine. Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, to name a few. I could easily write something about each of them, but it's worth checking them all out yourself. The one juror who really makes an impression in creating his character is Lee J. Cobb as the very aggressive juror who is hiding behind similarities to the case, having had a contentious relationship with his son that sparks his instant sense that the defendant is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. He was deservedly nominated for a Golden Globe (as was Fonda), but the Oscars only acknowledged the film, director and script for nominations. Each jury is its own story, and from city to city, nothing changes but the type of case and the date.",

For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none!

            "text": "12 Angry Men is the utmost in entertainment as a character study, but only that, not as jury reality. It is fascinating due to the magnificent actors who portrayed the jurors. The viewer becomes increasingly engrossed in the dialog by their superb acting, which transcends the drab setting of the jury deliberating room. However, as a lawyer myself, the movie contains an instance of jury impropriety, which ruins the film from a legal standpoint.During jury deliberations, one of the jurors brought in an item identical to one that was introduced at the trial and showed it to the other jurors. This is a classic case of improper jury behavior! Jurors may only consider the facts, witnesses, and evidence presented at trial and what may or may not be inferred from them; not outside items that were introduced in the deliberating room, such as this \"second\" item. Reasonable doubt in a criminal case must exist itself, not be deliberately manufactured by a juror. Additionally, the movie takes a considerable \"stretch of the imagination\" to conclude that not one of the other jurors reported this behavior to the judge at the time it happened. The juror who mentioned that it was against the law was ignored.Despite the excellent acting, 12 Angry Men is disturbing even if it is \"only a movie\" because the legal content is pure fiction. The movie gives a distortion about permissible jury conduct and would never have ended the way it did. If the case had been real, there would have been either a mistrial or this juror would have been dismissed and replaced with an alternate juror who heard the trial and the deliberations started over again. Also, the juror would probably have received a stern rebuke from the judge when he was dismissed, mistrial or not. This juror (the late Henry Fonda) was not some kind of \"hero\" as the viewer is led to believe, indeed, he was quite the contrary. 12 Angry Men is not a movie for someone who may be called for jury duty for the first time, despite how it may seem to those untrained in the legal system. I have read that this is the only movie Mr. Fonda ever produced (as well as acted) and, perhaps, he let his personal feelings of justice interfere with reality.",

It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of \"reasonable doubts\", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it! 10/10",

And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened.

Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too.

Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.Aside from Henry Fonda, all the other actors are a virtual \"who's who\" of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. Unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. Oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the TV show \"The Odd Couple\"--which starred Jack Klugman who was ALSO in 12 ANGRY MEN! See this film. And, if it turns out you don't like it, then I suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!",

The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a \"stubborn, pig-headed\" conservative versus \"righteous, just\" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",

            "text": "For decades now, films about 'social issues' have been problematic; making conscientious viewers believe they've thought deeply about a noble cause, and getting them to applaud themselves for embracing some progressive value that they probably already support*. This movie, in considering the responsibility of jury duty, neglects a finer point (& a larger idea) which remains undramatised; the process of American justice is not designed to declare people innocent... it only concludes whether the prosecution succeeded or failed at proving a person guilty; this is reflected by the very specific terms, Guilty and Not Guilty. A suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. No one is ever declared \"innocent.\" The difference is important (occasionally Not Guilty and Innocent are equivalent, but innocence is generally a higher standard). The jurors of '12 Angry Men' are confused about many things, but none moreso than this. The movie never clarifies this point. It would help these gentlemen immensely.At both ends of the spectrum - lynch mob to gee-whiz pushovers - the jury here utilizes thought-processes which are toxic to justice. The jerks are too interested in hanging. The 'bleeding hearts' - in the films parlance - are way too engaged in actively dismissing the whole case, not in merely detecting reasonable doubt. At one point Fonda has been able to discredit evidence (which is OK - a discovery supports this) and use a dicey method to disregard so much witness testimony (which is frankly, bizarre) that he might just as well start denying there was a victim, or that a crime occurred at all. \"What if the victim isn't dead?\" and \"What if there was no body?\" are only slightly more unreasonable than a few of his crazy, trial-negating suppositions.It remains a good idea for a movie. There are strong points (a moment when E.G. Marshall, as the reasonable opposition, quietly concedes is particularly powerful), and it's directed and shot well, but the script is so off-course that by the time the film ends most viewers will feel content that an innocent life has been saved, a moral determination not supported by the film, which is neutral concerning culpability. Worse, the offscreen case rings dramatically hollow when reassembled from the details we do get; it suggests some kind of flimsy, polemical courtroom, 'What on earth did these lawyers debate, if it wasn't the crime details? Was this a 4-minute trial?' I'm sure this movie had an impact on viewers likely to be called to jury duty, who WOULD prefer to wind things up so they could get to a ball game, but it does end up affirming that 12 people off the street are usually ignorant, and without some enlightened golden-boy on your jury (and a dramatic structure to reign them in) will hang your sorry ass. In a shocking example of tunnel-vision, the movie neglects to note that this nifty trick of persuasion might also be deployed by the morally un-righteous. To wit, couldn't just as interesting a scenario be imagined in which a juror whose motives are secretly nefarious, and who is intentionally trying to undermine the process, achieve the same reversal and get someone executed? Could one clever sociopath with a quick mind get a jury to reverse its verdict? That's a creepy, equally promising possibility which viewers aren't supposed to consider, but which is inherent in the premise, and which should have troubled a McCarthy-era audience. I think I'd actually like this movie if Fonda's moral value was left intentionally vague in the end, but it isn't. His righteousness is endorsed by heraldic music on the soundtrack and just so there's no mistaking his virtue, he walks away in a glowing white suit.This is only a good argument, not a good film. If you're the kind of viewer who prefers that there's no work to do to find a films meaning or your own nobility (Do you like To Kill a Mockingbird?), this is for you. There's no meaning to find, because none of it is hidden. It's all important on the surface. There isn't movie I love that's this overt with its meaning. 12 Angry Men is a nobility machine. Viewers are fed through it, and come out the other end righteous.(* Grapes of Wrath, Ox-Bow Incident, To Kill a Mockingbird, Call Northside 777, all of Jodie Fosters issue films, all of Kevin Costners issue films, etc.)",

'Red' is based on the first of the three novels 'Colors of Evil', which are: Red, Black, and White, by the writer Malgorzata Oliwia Sobczak. It is written and directed by Adrian Panek, who previously made 'Wake Up' for Netflix, as well as 'Hounds' outside the catalog. He also co-writes with Lukasz M. Maciejewski, well-known on the platform for 'The King of Warsaw', 'Mother's Day', and 'The Master of Escapes', which brings us our protagonist, Jakub Gierszal. Alongside him is Zofia Jastrzebska, whom we also know from 'Infamy' and 'The Girl and the Cosmonaut'. Now, combining crime and drama with serial killers, the premise goes like this: When the body of a young woman appears on a beach in the Tricity area of Poland, the prosecutor joins the victim's mother in an impetuous search for the truth.'The Colors of Evil: Red' is a decent, effective, very entertaining movie with a few surprises. Zofia Jastrzebska is fantastic... But when all is said and done, nothing has changed, you feel the same, you forget it. If you watch it, you'll have a good time; if not, you're not missing much. You won't find strong characters, an intelligent plot, anything you haven't seen before, nor brilliant direction, nor notable cinematography, music, or performances. It hardly has any action. However, it is quick, direct, concise, simple, and works as a distraction... But if you're looking for more, try a marvel like 'The Stranger', also on Netflix. Based on true events, it introduces two strangers who meet on a long journey. Apparently, they are two normal people with nothing to hide. But the reality is different, and they will soon discover it in the worst possible way. 'The Stranger' is a yes; 'The Colors of Evil: Red'... Maybe. Let me know if you like it.",

Or maybe did he not?A great acting was performed by Monika's mother, Helena, an acknowledged Polish actress Maja Ostaszewska. Her character is a family court judge, with a broken own family life, who tries to seek the truth. Performances of the rest of the cast were good, but rather forgetable. The victim, which we get to know better from flashbacks, a young actress Zofia Jastrzebska, did well in difficult graphic violence and nudity scenes.Script writer and filmmakers had an interesting general plot, but at times I had an impression, that they lacked an idea how to develop the action. Especially it was visible well before the end of the movie, when the police seem to enjoy an easy success against the main suspect, and the tension breaks. Some will find an interesting plot twist, some - incredible plot holes.All in all, a decent film to watch.

Her mother, and former police chief, Helena (Maja Ostaszewska) joins forces with prosecutor Leopold Bilski (Jakub Gierszel) to track down the killer, and suspicion falls on feared local gangster Kazar (Prezemyslaw Bluszcz), when a ball of severed lips is found in his possession, but as events draw on, things are not as clear as they seem.Foreign cinema has an unnerving ability to deliver thrillers in a cold, dark, grey style, of the sort that we see increasingly less of on this side of the pond. This Bulgarian effort, from director Adrian Panek, features a slew of actors unheard of on these shores, with names so unpronounceable they make Schwarzenegger sound positively easy. What at first seems a slightly cold and uninviting affair, gradually develops into an intriguing and rewarding thriller that keeps you hooked till the end.Aside from the moodiness and uninviting greys of the lighting, Panek's film is also unafraid to shy away from some brutal, blood letting violence, liable to illicit a flinch or two from the squeamish. While as a film it unflinchingly delves into the grimy and uncomfortable world it inhabits, it's also carefully wrought, with some clever twists and turns along the way, and unexpected plot developments that allow the story to breathe and hold you in.It's a bit of a slow starter, with maybe not the most dynamic opening, but it's ultimately a highly rewarding effort, even if it does take a lot out of you to get to the end. ****",

A young woman is tortured, has witnessed a man brutalised and then murdered by his employer in front of a room full of people, then decides to go and tell the police- only to find the police are in on it, and march her straight back into the lair of this monster for him to attack her yet again.There were also some disappointing choices as to who the actual murderer was, which I thought in a way let the most abhorrent character in the story off lightly.Despite this, somehow, SOMETHING compelled me to keep watching and see how all this turned out, despite feeling very uncomfortable, which must mean the story (or directing choices?) at least had something going for them.So if you want to watch a film that makes you feel thoroughly depressed with a feeling of existential gloom, and at points makes you feel somewhat ill, this is the film for you.",

Police and senior prosecutors are determined to declare this: Case Solved & Closed. But a junior prosecutor continues to investigate and brings his suspicions to the girl's mother, a judge. Plenty of red herrings here regarding the suspects but it soon becomes obvious (to all but the senior prosecutor) that a long list of women have disappeared or been found murdered over the past 20 years. A dark, disturbing film with scenes of abuse, violence and gory murders. A club run by a crime boss figures in several of the deaths as does police corruption, corruption which likely extend further in the judicial system.

Big big shoes to fill, I completely love Fury Road - a perfect action film in every way, so I was prepared to have this film fall in its shadow. Which it did. Furiosa is fun but its sadly no FR.The good news:\nYou want action? There is action, loads of it. Like any good Mad Max story it holds true to its promise to entertain the masses with spectacle. Glorious. We get the hot rods, big wheels, diggers, bikes of all shapes and sizes, as well as flying contraptions, weaponry galore and no holding back on the violence. Explosions, bodies flying, witness me etc. Plenty. It can be brutal and nasty but true to form and true to Mad Max. What more do you want?Casting is good, perhaps a few too many characters leaving each of them to have not quite enough to do especially with Immortan Joe's followers. Anja Taylor Joy is good as Furiosa and Hemsworth seems to really be enjoying himself. Dementus is a great villain, a sort of love child of Immortan Joe and The Humungus; the presence, the wee speeches, his villainy is fun. And he gets to be very Aussie no need to hide that accent. I also liked a younger and much cleverer Immortan Joe; in this film he's not the core bad guy and without the need to get his 5 wives back as a motivator making him crazy we get to see him as the warlord he is. Smart and patient and in control.And there's world building! Which was very cool. We got to see more of the Wasteland and get hints of how it ticks and what made it so.The bad news:\nVisually Furiosa is a bit of a mixed bag; sometimes we get stuff worthy of its predecessor and other times we get stuff that is... less so. The colour is much more pale than the richness of FR and the cinematography is no where near the standards. Occasionally the CGI lets the film down just a bit. In Fury Road you got the impression that it was almost all practical effects even if it wasn't. In Furiosa there are sequences where I went... 'eww, yikes' as the standards of the film dropped. Only a few moments but be prepared.The music is often absent or very lacking. The sweeping epics of Fury Road are almost gone instead we get much more background stuff or even sadly largely silent action sequences. This leads to a lack of tension, nothing edge of your seat here.The writing and edit isn't great. The characters lack spark and bits feel missing. Miller is trying to tell a story but seems unsure of how to write characters in which one can invest. Furiosa has more ambition in its story telling and I think its execution is lacking. The core story solid but it seems a bit empty on the screen. The film jumps at times skipping over character development worthy of exploration.In the edit i really really missed the fast cuts of Fury where Miller really built his scenes through tight production and cuts and edits where everything builds beautifully and leads to a great conclusions. Miller did this scene after scene in FR whereas in Furiosa its really lacking. Means theres not as much tension, not as many 'that was close' nor 'that was amazing' moments.Overall I did like it. Furiosa is a good Mad Max film but its no Fury Road. I'd be surprised if the film is recognized at Oscar time, where Fury Road won 6 Furiosa might get a nomination or two in the technical but no nominations for Directing or Best Picture.By my deeds I honour him...By my wallet I honour George Miller, Witness Furiosa. Its worth your time and money but not more than that.",

It's a completely different film in its structure which allows it to be a prequel that tells a complete story on its own whilst still enhancing Fury Road with its world building. The fact that George Miller is still telling stories in the wasteland at this scale is a real gift.Alyla Brown gets a lot more screen time than child versions of pre-established characters usually get and with next to no dialogue she is superb at communicating everything without words. Carrying that on for the second half, Anya Taylor-Joy does a phenomenal job and was right to fight to keep the scream in. If you need someone to act exclusively with their eyes, she is as perfect as they come.Chris Hemsworth is clearly relishing the opportunity to play a properly mad villain with Dementus and has so many chill inducing moments. This is easily the best he's been so far, completely unhinged with just enough depth to explain everything he does. He's a complicated figure who always seeks power but is never able to truly hold onto it.George Miller truly is a genius when it comes to exploring this franchise. Getting to see a fully realised Gas Town and Bullet Farm allows this world to cohere like never before and the action crafted here is so epic with gorgeous imagery that refuses to slow down. Just like John Seale achieved last time, Simon Duggans's cinematography can keep the action clean no matter what's thrown at it.It makes sense that the only way Tom Holkenborg could come close to his best work on Fury Road was to return to the wasteland and his score here continues to compliment the kineticism of the action so well. The only downside is the CGI which looks pretty bad at various points and stands out further because of how well Fury Road implemented it.",

The story is told very well via voice-over which was a very welcome surprise. Going into this I read Anya Taylor Joy had about 30 lines, which I found extremely little. Comparing to that, Tom Hardy spoke bibles full. However, the lack of a dialogue from her does not feel forced or troublesome at all! She speaks when needed and zips it when not.Where Fury Road was a movie PACKED with action and chase scenes, this movie really does expand on the little knowledge we have of the world which was not needed to watch Fury Road but was very fun to see. The sets are beautifully made, but as much as I love Anya Taylor Joy, for me she could not compare to Charlize Theron who will always stay Furiosa for me. However, Anya really does shine in this movie and the chasing scene in the end is absolutely scintellating to experience. The beautiful music by Junkie XL really does add a lot to the movie.Overall, this movie about 'the fifth rider of the apocalypse' is beautiful, captivating and I am ever so glad to have seen it.",

Furiosa takes on a much more different aesthetic with the use of slightly more darker and less vibrant colors, a much different protagonist, and a more complex story.

After the incredible cinematography magic that genius John Seale weaved, Furiosa felt just like some lacklustre adaptation of a far superior source material.Only thing I found charming was the overall 80's feel, resembling the style of a Road Warrior, and some scenes feel like they were recreated straight from the original trilogy. While action sequences are, as expected, top notch, the epic sense of awe and sheer crazy excitement that ludicrous stunts and choreography brought us in Fury Road was lacking. Editing was sometimes atrocious. Even in the best action or \"poignant\" scenes this movie had to offer, I never felt that I'm watching it from the edge of my seat, nor did I get emotionally involved with any of characters.Speaking of which, acting was fairly wooden, lines declamatory delivered, the script overall seemed recycled and overly done, bordering on boring. Storytelling was chaotic, rushed and dragged at the same time. Sometimes the unnecessary narrator helped things to move along, unfortunately in a bad way.But the major flaw was that there was no hero's journey for any of characters. Furiosa is the same person at the beginning as she is at the end of a movie, same as Dementus. Remember Nux and his journey? There is nothing like it in Furiosa. Furthermore, Furiosa endures every hardship with the same fierce look in her eyes - we never see pain, never fear, never doubt. She shrugs any injury off, like a terminator. It was hard to get emotionally involved with her character. Unfortunately, she came across as a classic girl boss, amazing in everything she does from the start to the finish, as a kid, and as an adult. Relationship between Furiosa and Praetorian Jack is so robotic and unemotional it's painful to watch. Dementus's monologue at the end was a snoozefest.

Her performance is nuanced, capturing the raw survival instinct and emotional complexity of a young woman navigating a brutal, post-apocalyptic world. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances that add layers to the narrative and enrich the overall experience.The film's action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. Miller's direction ensures that every chase, fight, and explosion is not only thrilling but also coherent and impactful. The practical effects and stunts are awe-inspiring, creating a visceral experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Visually, \"Furiosa\" is a masterpiece. The cinematography and production design transport viewers to a desolate yet strangely beautiful wasteland, where every frame is meticulously crafted to immerse the audience fully. The score, too, complements the film perfectly, enhancing the tension and emotional beats with its powerful compositions.Beyond the action, \"Furiosa\" offers a compelling story of resilience, rebellion, and redemption. It delves into the origins of one of the franchise's most iconic characters, providing a rich backstory that fans will find deeply satisfying. The film balances its high-octane sequences with moments of genuine character development and emotional resonance.Overall, \"Furiosa\" is a triumphant return to the world of Mad Max. It's a must-watch for fans of the series and a standout action film in its own right, combining breathtaking action, strong performances, and a gripping narrative to create an unforgettable cinematic experience.",

The look is off everything from camerawork to editing to the costumes to vehicles to action scenes. Loads of bad CGI replaces the high octane realistic crazy stunts and motor mayhem from fury road. It all looks shot in a studio with fake everything. Big drop in quality and a sense of realism.It's sad to see that Miller has settled for the studio instead of real vehicles in real environments with neck breaking stunts. Both clothes and vehicles just looks very designed now as well instead of a somewhat believable mishmash of what can be found in the wastelands. It's also a-lot cleaner in every way, vehicles look shiny and newly made. It just feels more censored and less naked and rough.The story surprises nobody and is pretty much exactly what you expect. Void from a lot of the epic action scenes you might have to expect after fury road. You get some decent action but Fury Road is the gold standard here and this is not even close. Look and feels more like a cookie cutter action movie set in the Mad Max universe. Had I have to guess without knowing it I would never have guessed that Miller directed this. The world building is cool though and you get more of the cool world of Mad Max so that is a big plus.Actors do a decent to a good job all around.Immortan Joe is not impressed.MEDIOCRE!!!",

The opening scene shows a young Furiosa being kidnapped and blowing a whistle to call for help. A whole village of people hear the call but literally only two people respond. She is taken away and there are clearly opportunities when she could have been saved but she isn't for the sake of the plot. This kidnapping scene drags on with poor dialogue and lifeless humor. This was just the beginning of what the rest of this film would be.Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) is a ridiculously lousy character. He was supposed to be the villain but takes on more of a comedic role. From the moment he appears on screen he looks like the parody of a villain. He has a prosthetic nose; he's wearing a white sheet for a cape and accessorizes his outfit with a teddy bear chained to his back. So, it was impossible to take him serious at all especially with that distracting nose that felt pointless to say the least. It didn't help that his dialogue was also playful and made this film a nightmare tonally.The younger versions of Furiosa not played by Anya Taylor-Joy were well acted but took up too much of the run time. Anya Taylor-Joy was okay as Furiosa. However, there are scenes involving her character that didn't make sense like her walking around The Citadel with long hair unnoticed. Or Immortan Joe never noticing she's gone. Not to mention her escape when she loses her arm. Praetorian Jack (Tom Burke) was also just an okay character. I didn't mind his role in the story.While the visuals were similar to those of \"Fury Road\", the action scenes didn't feel as intense. There were also random points in the film where someone would narrate the story which was a weird direction to tell this story.Overall, this film was too long. There are too many scenes that are longer than they needed to be. It was boring for most of its runtime and failed to explore things that would have been more interesting. A forgetful prequel.",

I admire it as an action vehicle but as a movie overall it just really leaves me wanting. I've thought this for years but it only really got confirmed to me once it rewatched it the day before I finally saw this movie. The fact that this movie was supposed to be so different from Fury Road was quite appealing to me going in since I don't totally gel with that movie and overall I'm amazed by how much I enjoyed it given my somewhat mixed feelings on the predecessor.I think where this film succeeds for me compared to Fury Road is that it does takes its time more. There's considerably more world building and moments to breathe between the action scenes. In Fury Road this was very much absent by design but I loved the fact that Miller took a different approach here. I really liked the gradually pace this film took and how it fleshed out this surprisingly interesting world. The one thing I can't deny about Fury Road is how incredible the action scenes are and that's no different here. I think the big difference for me is that there's more build up to them and as such I thought there were more stakes going into them. They're long and jaw dropping in scale and it really does give me an urge to finally watch the original films.The performances and character work are also top notch and I really appreciate the fact that those are things George Miller doesn't skimp on in his action movies. Anya Taylor-Joy is basically perfect as Furiosa and obviously she's going to be compared with Charlize Theron but ultimately I think both of their portrayals compliment each other very well. While her arc does follow a template we've seen before I ultimately thought it worked very well and I was always interested what action she was going to take next. A big credit for that has to go to Chris Hemsworth who is outstanding and this is easily the best performance I've ever seen him give. He's not the deepest villain I've ever seen but's he's very memorable and Hemsworth gives such an entertaining performance that I just always wanted to see more of him on screen. Tom Burke was also great in a role that I thought was surprisingly wholesome but also quite mysterious in all the right ways.The story itself though is definitely where the film falters the most for me though. It's split up into very distinctive chapters and in many ways I liked that about it but it also hurt the pacing somewhat. It felt as if the film had to keep re-starting with every new chapter and for as jaw dropping as the action scenes are their length became a bit tiring since the story is so bare bones. I also think the actual ending could've been stronger given that it very much leads directly into Fury Road and the transformation of the Furiosa here into the one in that film didn't feel entirety earned to me.I had no idea what to expect going into Furiosa but I was so pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It feels like such a natural expansion of the world set up by Fury Road and the character work is surprisingly very strong.

I was glad to see them do something like this, as I now will remember them for these roles!Cinematography.. excellent!

The lack of contrast and ups and downs in the film prevents you from getting engaged and understanding it. Even the director fails to create the suspense he aims to instill in you. In terms of special effects and sound quality, if I were to compare it with the film \"Dune II\" that I watched on the same IMAX screen two months ago, I must say it was really unsuccessful in this area.

There was even a couple of times I was convinced Charlize was dubbing her lines. She was a good match for a younger Furiosa. But she doesnt even appear in the movie until half way. The story is just too long and convoluted and there is no sense of time. Like there is a scene where the Furiosa warns the citadel is going to be attacked next, but theres no sense of urgency. Furiosa has time to not only heal from an injury, but to craft and shave her head etc and still catches back up to the bad guys? Theres also a scene before that when shes returning back to the citadel and it pans up the mountain and it looks like (or is implied) that its Mad Max at the beginning of Fury Road. So is this supposed to be taking place around the same time? It was just confusing. Also is her character motivated to return home or for revenge? It feels like it wants to be both but they contradict each other at times. I didnt even really like Chris Hemsworth in this. He wasnt very menacing. Immortan Joe was more memorable. Chris Hemsworth was a tad campy for my liking. Not sure why he needed a fake nose. I also didnt like the editing at times. It felt like they had background actors sped up while other things moved a normal pace and so it kind of gave the style of claymation at times but it just looked really janky and out of place. Fury Road felt so real because the majority of the movie was practical but theres numerous scenes in this movie where it feels like theyre in front of green screen. Theres also CGI dogs in this movie that look like CGI dogs. And I get thats becoming more frequent in the industry to not put any animals in harms way but...it just looks distracting.Again the best part for me was Anya Taylor-Joy. There is also some good action scenes. I think the production design looked good. Its not a \"bad\" film just was a step down from the last.",

This prequel to the critically acclaimed \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" not only expands the lore of the titular character but also redefines the boundaries of the action genre. Anya Taylor-Joy had 30 lines of dialogue that delivers a tour-de-force performance as Furiosa, embodying the character with a fierce determination and emotional depth that captivates from the first frame. Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of the villainous Dementus is both charismatic and menacing, providing a perfect foil to Furiosa's heroism. George Miller's direction after watching FURY ROAD is nothing short of masterful & beautiful creations of what road action is really like; he crafts a narrative that is both expansive and intimate, with each set piece surpassing the last in scale and spectacle. The cinematography is a character in itself, painting the Wasteland of \"WHAT A LOVELY DAY\" with a palette that is as beautiful as it is desolate.\"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" is a testament to the power of myth-making. It's a film that not only honors its predecessors but also stands on its own as a monumental achievement in cinema. With a perfect blend of relentless action, compelling characters, and a story that resonates with the human spirit's indomitable will, this film is the best films of this year of action.

Miller and his team stepped it up even more from Fury Road, still giving the same look and feel of the brutal Wasteland, but with even more grittiness and realism, obviously taking advantage of advances in production since 2015.Overall it is one of those rare prequels that is better than what was already a great sequel.

Movies today, from the sprawling epics of \"Dune\" to the interconnected sagas of the MCU, seem to require a viewer's full dedication-and maybe even a notepad to keep up. This isn't to diminish their artistry, but it's clear that the pure joy of cinema, the sort of effortless fun Hollywood once peddled so well, has become a rare find. A film that welcomes you without prerequisites, \"The Fall Guy,\" seeks to reignite that spark of unadulterated entertainment. It aims to dazzle with the sheer magnetism of its leads, thrust into a whirlwind of romance and adventure, harking back to the days when stunts were real and filmmaking was a team sport, offering a joyride that's as heartwarming as it is thrilling.Hollywood's narrative-rich turn hasn't dulled the magic of star power, a fact \"The Fall Guy\" embraces wholeheartedly, reminiscent of a time when the charm of icons like Burt Reynolds was all the spectacle one needed. Ryan Gosling proves his mettle as a jack-of-all-trades, winning hearts even in the most casual settings, his performance in this film further cementing his versatile appeal.\"The Fall Guy\" also champions the unsung heroes of cinema: the stunt performers. Through breathtaking feats and daredevil escapades, it pays homage to the risk-takers who've silently shaped cinematic history, although it's not without its critiques, especially in how it sidelines some of its stellar cast in the latter half.Yet, beyond the adrenaline, there's a poignant commentary on the digital age's challenges to authenticity, making \"The Fall Guy\" a vibrant counterpoint to the prevailing trends of faceless, CGI-dominated blockbusters. It's a film that doesn't just want to entertain; it wants to remind us of the value of genuine connection, both on the screen and in the stunts that make us hold our breath. In doing so, it doesn't just invite audiences to have fun; it demands it, championing the kind of cinema that's been overshadowed by the gravitas of today's tentpoles.",

Perhaps never before have a film been focused so much on the unseen heroes behind many great films - the stunt doubles delivering shockingly realistic portrayals of the action. And in that respect The Fall Guys succeeds- it's action sequences are delivered flawlessly, and are breathtaking to behold. They climax to a crescendo at the ending, where a several vehicles crash, flip and explode, all in sync with action involving a helicopter in the sky with our main character. Praise should also be given to the films two charismatic leads. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling share palpable chemistry and are simply endearing to behold. They are affable, amiable, and funny. But ultimately my problem with this film is that it is unevenly paced, lacks enough humour, and has too thin a plot to retain an audiences full attention. The films firstly takes too long to get its plot started, resulting in a laborious introduction, a sped through mid section, and a bombastic but slightly rushed ending. The film also does not exert its full potential of comedy. The film does not make use of action comedy(as best exemplified by the Jackie Chan films) or a particularly witty script. Indeed the script is rather dull, sometimes trite, and altogether not very sharp or exciting. Then there is the films plot. I can comment not much other than that it is the recyclable convoluted B-grade plots which are common in movies. It is predictable, ludicrous, and quite inexcusable. So at the end of the day, The Fall Guys is a good comedy that acts as a wonderful tribute to the art of stunt work, bolstered by strong, effervescent performances between its two leads. But for movie watchers who do not care much for the films impressive stunts, The Fall Guys will prove to be a rather empty watch. Serviceable, but unexceptional.",

This is a love letter to the stunt team, a film dedicated to showing the grittiness and the roughness of the industry and how the movie industry will fall apart without them. Not only that, this is also a film for anyone who loves films or filmmaking in general.Just like how Barbie was meta for the toy industry, The Fall Guy is meta for the filmmaking industry. Plenty of subtle and hidden messages that were incorporated in the script. Ex: There was one scene that spontaneously mentioned on how the stunt team didn't get any recognition at the Oscars. There was even distinct mentions or references of Taylor Swift, Dune, Kill Bill and Miami Vice amongst many others. Plenty were about the movie industry that if you spotted those things, you would truly have a good time in the cinemas.Marketed as an action rom-com, this film didn't fill its promise with the comedy. It's an element that's just lacking from beginning 'til the end. Of course, it wasn't empty, it had its moments but for a comedy film, it didn't achieve the bar it was supposed to. You might be smiling or left out a few chuckles, but they weren't anything that were just worth bursting out loud. Again, comedy is extremely subjective.The Fall Guy did very well the first 30 minutes of the film. Everything you wanted it to be was conveyed really well. David Leitch opened the film about a film who's working for that film. It fully maximizes everything exciting regarding this subject. The main focus was about filmmaking and the stunt community. It shed light on these unsung heroes, showcasing their dedication and talent in bringing action-packed scenes to life. And damn, it is very good and entertaining.When the second act came in, we started to lose a bit of interest in this movie. Mainly due to its shift of focus that it somehow turned into a murder mystery genre. First act was very good that it talked a lot on filmmaking, and almost every scene was located in a production set. The dialogues were also heavy on that. But the middle part focused more on the murder mystery and romance. While they still included a lot of the meta elements here but they turned its way into a more generic film when it could have been so much more.Even most of the dialogues during the romance scenes were just not as good as the rest of the script. They just didn't maximize the stuff they were talking about. Some dialogues felt meaningless. Some were just flat out boring. Some have meanings but if only they could polish them, this movie would have been so much better.Luckily, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt sparked a good chemistry on set. Even with a moment of no dialogues, just when they're looking at each other, you'll know well enough their chemistry is just electrifyingly good. There were moments they weren't physically together, but the film showed them on a split screen and etc. But the palpable connection between them remained strong.The movie redeems itself at the third act. It's a very epic ending and you rarely see this kind of ending in an action rom-com movie. The action and the scope were big and the messages were all very on-point with the whole theme of the film. It's bombastic but it's lovely at the same time. It's less on fighting or punching, but more on the performing of stunts. 2-3 scenes felt and looked like they came straight out from old classic films. There's just a certain way that the ending was shot that it gave a homage to old action movies. It's indeed a sight to behold.Verdict: A love letter to the unsung heroes, The Fall Guy pays homage to the stunt community, exploring their hardships behind the scenes through the lens of both a director and a stuntman. While it falls short on delivering promised comedy, its first act shines with interesting filmmaking commentary. Despite a weak second act, strong chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt along with an epic finale elevate the film, delivering a visually stunning tribute to classic cinema.P. S: There's a mid-credit scene! Stay tuned!",

It's a loving tribute to the never ending selflessness of stunt people wrapped inside of an endearing romantic comedy and meta action film. If David Leitch and 87 North did all the action in cinema the world would be a better place.Ryan Gosling achieves new levels of perfection by merging the reserved stunt man character of Drive with his natural Kenergy. His version of Colt is just so lovable, especially because he's completely unafraid to be open in his vulnerability which makes him more relatable whilst being really funny. His comedic timing continues to be faultless, proving he can make any joke land.Emily Blunt thankfully also gets a lot to do. Any scene she shares with Gosling is effortlessly charming and she has her own brand of bona-fide movie star charisma. Winston Duke is a great movie referencing support to Gosling, Aaron Taylor-Johnson does a hilarious McConaughey impression and Hannah Waddingham's cartoonishly over the top producer really works.David Leitch's direction plays squarely to his strengths and after the disappointment of The Gray Man, it's extra satisfying to see Gosling be given some actually good fight scenes. Stunt designer Chris O'Hara and the whole stunt team really accomplished some breathtaking feats that are only made more impressive by seeing how they shot them during the credits.",

It's not to say that praise isn't warranted, but the film surprised me with its numerous shortcomings. While the stunts are undeniably impressive, perhaps the best in movie history, the glaring lack of well-scripted dialogue and a compelling plot significantly detract from its overall quality.Moreover, it seemed that the movie prioritized showcasing Ryan Gosling's appearance over demonstrating any depth or range in character development. Yes, the chemistry between Gosling and Emily Blunt is believable, but ultimately, the film felt more like a drawn-out chick flick than a substantial cinematic experience.While the ending may offer some satisfaction, it's not enough to redeem the film entirely. If your sole reason for watching \"The Fall Guy\" is to admire Gosling's good looks, I find it hard to believe, but even then, the movie leaves much to be desired.",

I think in any case that today Ryan has been typecast in these roles, as happens in Barbie and that although he is useful today, perhaps in the future not so much.Emily Blunt in a totally secondary role and with a romance with Gosling's character that borders on the cloying and not very credible at times.The point is that this movie is an action nonsense that lasts more than 2 hours and that is appreciated as long as we close our minds to any other analysis.The action scenes and how it is filmed are the best of this film, at times it rivals the best of John Wick in that sense.The humor works no matter how crude and physical comedy it is.It's basically an action movie from the 90's, it reminds us a lot of Arnold's \"Last Action Hero\" and that's appreciated.In short, a good movie for a Saturday afternoon, it is not strictly necessary to go to the cinema to see it but it is very entertaining.",

While Gosling's portrayal adds depth and charisma, the movie suffers from a disjointed plot that leaves viewers with unanswered questions and moments that feel unnecessary.One of the film's shortcomings lies in its lack of clarity and connection to the central plot, leading to confusing scenes that detract from the overall narrative coherence. Emily Blunt, despite her talent, is constrained by underdeveloped scripting for her character, Jody, resulting in a relationship dynamic with Gosling's character, Colt, that lacks believability and depth. The imbalance in character development creates a sense of manipulation and blame within their relationship, which undermines the emotional connection the film tries to establish.Nevertheless, The Fall Guy does have its bright spots, with humorous scenes, witty lines, and commendable performances from supporting actors Aaron Tyler-Johnson as Tom and Hannah Waddingham as Gail, who bring life to their villainous roles.Ultimately, while Ryan Gosling's performance shines, The Fall Guy struggles to fully engage me as an audience due to its weak storyline and character dynamics.",

A weak screenplay.Colt Seavers (Ryan Gosling) is the stuntman who got badly injured while doubling for big screen star Tom Ryder (Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) He always claims to do his own stunts.Colt got out of the movie industry. Some time later he gets a call from producer Gail (Hannah Waddingham) to go out to Australia as Ryder has gone missing.It would allow Colt to reunite with Jody (Emily Blunt), a camera operator he had the hots for. She is directing the movie in Australia and if Ryde cannot be found, the studio will pull the plug.Maybe Universal Studio should had pulled the plugged for this until they had a better story. It takes a while to get going. It is a hackneyed plot.It is left for the stunts to do the heavy lifting. They are good but not amazing. The plot is the drag.At least there is a reference to the television show at the end. Maybe this should had been about stuntman turned bounty hunter. Instead you have to take the title of the film literally.There were a few nice touches. When Colt saves a person with force, there was the Six Million Dollar Man sound effects used.

Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing.

I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the \"good\" characters, but also with the \"evil\" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",

The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more.

And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.

It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the \"Fellowship\" film.Anyway, \"Fellowship,\" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",

            "text": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Today is my birthday. Honestly, it is. It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful'? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments.Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this: THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago.I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I've just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English :-). We must go on!There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it's coming to me. It's coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she's leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can't believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn't see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track.FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let's go to what there is to see.\nI saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don't know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I'm never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don't have to say much about this, but so that you know it: Howard Shore's score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart.Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious' shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it's magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. \"Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time...\" \"No, Bilbo, stay away\". \"IT's MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS!\" It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won't leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don't want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees \"what is to come\"). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can't say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn't played for long, but I began to realise. what's next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn't believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there's evil there, that does not sleep . Now you get the picture; I love this film! I love LORD OF THE RINGS. This is just remarkable. My imagination. oh, I have no imagination. I did not, could not, imagine this. Imagine there's no people. Imagine if this film had not been made. I may have lived my life without knowing this story. All of you who read the book and hate them for turning this into a movie. Think of all of us who now have been rescued from living our lives without it. Thank you, everyone behind this film, for making it.Koola from NorwayA small PS: The fellowship. It was beautifully casted. Flawless. Gimli - unforgettable John Rhys-Davies. The hobbits - just charming to their hairy feet, and they touched me deep. Aragorn and Boromir - more than anything, believable. They are men, they have no effects or make-up to characterize them. But they are massive. They suffer, and it hurts. Viggo Mortensen is my hero. (And did you all know he is related to Denmark, my neighbourcountry?). Legolas though.. He was my favourite. Feels weird to write the least about the character I loved the most, but it's just. not much to say. Could not stand seeing Legolas leave the screen, he had an remarkable impact on me with his. elvish magic. Oh, and one last thing. This is a chaos. My mind is a chaos. FOTR is so much, much more. I haven't said a thing about Galladriel, and a lot more. But there has to be a limit. If I were you now, I would look forward to every second of this film, so then. it does not matter.\nI will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. It is that good.",

            "text": "...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read \"The Lord of the Rings\" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Silmarillion\" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in \"The Hobbit\" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried \"ranger\". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",

            "text": "Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of \"book of the century\"), bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning, and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire, to the enchanting elvish woods, to the imposing mountains and plains, it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images, like that of Mount Doom, are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines, huge towers, cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect, with Howard Shore's suspenseful, exciting, and emotional score a real plus, especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this, great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story, because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written, the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time, the film never drags, even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes, sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre, arty depiction of life in the \"netherworld\" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky, supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting, pacing, suspense, tension, and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role, but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional, weak in body but strong in spirit hero, a real centre piece for the film to evolve around, and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role, making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn), especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas, and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf, and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally, kudos to Sean Bean, for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character, with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood, sweat and clanging steel, and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship, which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work, I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great, expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look \"cartoony\" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true, and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll, thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects, and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog, just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen, flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout, and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough, and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made, although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff.

            "text": "I really tried to go into this movie with an open mind.  I knew that much would be left out due to time restrictions.  I was aware through the promotional campaign that the dialog was going to be un-Tolkien, for reasons I wasn't clear about, since they seem to have gone to considerable effort to get pronunciations correct.  I knew that there would be many things about both the story and the treatment of it that would conflict with my own hide-bound (some would say fossilized) ideas.But still I looked forward to it.Then they showed Sauron in the second shot of the movie and somewhere inside, I wailed in despair.   I knew, from that alone, that Peter Jackson didn't get it.What is the one thing in LOTR that is never shown?  The one thing so evil and horrible that it isn't even described?Sauron.  The title character.  The Lord of the Rings himself.There he is, in the second shot of the movie.  Some funny looking big guy whose armourer has either very very bad taste or a sick sense of humor.The whole prologue was very aggravating to me, because as I watched it I knew that both the structure of the story and the slow building of understanding that characterized Tolkien's telling of it were being ignored. Throughout \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (the book, that is) we see the story unfold largely through Frodo's eyes.  We don't know about the conspiracy between Merry, Pippin and Sam because Frodo doesn't.  We don't know who the Black Riders are because Frodo doesn't.  And we don't know the history of the Ring until Gandalf tells Frodo about it.  Putting us in the hobbit's shoes brings us into the story.  The prologue in the movie separates us from it.On a technical level, the cinematography and editing were completely wrong for a story of this type -- other than a few wide sweeping shots of the fellowship walking south from Rivendell, the movie seemed all wide-angle lenses, swish pans, jump cuts, Spike Lee zooms (zooming in while dollying back or vice versa) or gratuitous and excessive special effects.  When Frodo puts the ring on, why does it suddenly get windy?  I rather think Bilbo would have noticed something was odd about the ring if all that had happened when he put it on.  Almost without exception, all the special effects were over-the-top.  From the glow of the fiery letters shining on Frodo's face (which, I will admit, looked kind of cool) to the flaming eye of Sauron.In a word, the film lacked subtlety.  Tolkien would have been hopping mad.And Arwen at the bridge made me mad, too.  In the book, Frodo stands, weak and wounded on the opposite shore from the Nazgul, and yet with his remaining strength defies them.  This is a crucially important moment in his development and our understanding of his character.Though the waves with horses was a nice touch.Speaking of Arwen at the bridge, there are many annoying examples of small changes to the plot done for no apparent reason.  Why was it Frodo who figured out how to open the gates of Moria?  And why wasn't Sam at the mirror of Galadriel?  Why did Aragorn show up before the orcs finished off Boromir (actually, that one's obvious -- so we could waste more time with another damn fight scene, that's why)?  and why was he not present when the black riders attacked the hobbits at Weathertop?It is possible to transfer a book successfully to screen faithfully.  For example, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone\" does an admirable job.  I gave the movie a seven out of ten and full marks for keeping within both the letter and the spirit of the book.  It left some things out, but you could tell that the filmmakers respected the book, the author, and the book's legion of readers.Several key dynamics from LOTR were thrown out in the movie.  The whole business of the mysterious disappearance of Gandalf is left out, and replaced with one of the most bone-jarringly stupid scenes in the film: I call it Gandalf vs. Saruman in the temple of Doom.  Was that silliness necessary?  The Wizards in the film may have been quick to anger, but subtle they most decidedly were not.The Legolas-Gimli relationship was likewise ignored, as well as the process of Aragorn gaining the hobbits' trust (especially Sam's).   But this simply underscores the greatest weakness in the movie -- it doesn't build the characters, it takes them for granted.And what of poor Barliman?  He was given such short shrift.  Not to mention Tom Bombadil.  I read a viewer comment in this forum defending his omission which said (quoting here): `a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age'.  That's exactly the point:  LOTR is not about this day and age.By and large, the casting was fine, with the following exceptions:Agent Smith from \"The Matrix\" as Elrond. For God's sake, Weaving even slipped in and out of the \"Agent Smith\" voice.Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn.  He was capable of playing the fighter, but either wasn't capable or given the opportunity to reveal the historian, linguist, lore-learned Aragorn.The interchangeable actors as Merry and Pippin.  Except for their accents, they weren't easy to tell apart.It's easy to say that even at three hours, the film was too short to cover all the ground in the book (and I will certainly not argue this -- I estimate a faithful, yet watchable treatment at about 24 hours -- but Ken Burns' \"Baseball\" was almost that long, wasn't it?), but far too much of that precious time was spent in the action and fight scenes.  The Chamber of Mazarbul scene (the fight with the troll) was one of the better action scenes, and handled very skillfully, but I would have traded most of it for a better treatment of the Council of Elrond (like, why the heck is Boromir there?  Who is Gimli, and why is he at Rivendell? Why wasn't Bilbo there? His offer to take the Ring was most revealing in the book).  And, of course, the whole prologue should have been moved into Frodo's sitting room, where Professor Tolkien wisely put it.It comes down to this.  They didn't trust the book.  The darned thing sold fifty MILLION copies.  That's a BILLION dollars worth of books.  And has a legion of admirers dwarfing Harry Potter's.  But they didn't trust it.One of the things I truly admired about the late Robert Shaw (I sing in the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus) was that he never tried to put his own `stamp' on a piece of music.  His purpose was always to get at the heart of the music, to serve the composer and the composer's intentions.In a way, a film treatment of a book is a `performance' of that book.  And the better the book, the more beloved by the reading public, the more incumbent it is upon the performer to strive for the heart and soul of the book.  Peter Jackson got much that was superficially right, but missed the life at the center.  The film is cold, frightening, and utterly unlike The Lord of the Rings.Finally, the most disappointing thing:  because any Lord of the Rings film would have to be a production of epic scale, this version may have to stand as the only real attempt at a  film adaptation for many years, perhaps forever.  There have been dozens of \"Hamlet's, and even a bunch of \"Tarzan\"s.  And that's one thing that kept running through my mind:  \"This is IT.  This is the treatment that LOTR will get in the cinema. Damn.\"",

            "text": "It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that.",

            "text": "I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'\" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: \"Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?\".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10",

            "text": "Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.",

            "text": "When I first read \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. \"Star Wars\" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination.Well, imagination has found life in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel \"The Hobbit\", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.",

            "text": "Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the \"Titanic\" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.",

            "text": "I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life.",

The special-effects, the cast and and the production are great - but for every acceptable or good change to the original story you find at least the same amount of really bad choices Jackson made. Let me just give the example of who is responsible for going through Moria in the book and on the other hand in the movie. Why change it to Frodo and give him the burden of Gandalf's death? Why do not let Aragorn take the broken sword out of Rivendell? These are just needless and bad changes to the original story, and there are more examples for that kind of things.But nevertheless the movies made a break for the fantasy-genre and will spawn a lot of movies from the same kind (or so I hope). Jackson deserves credit for that. The Lord of the Rings is something you have to see - but not something you have to like.",

The movie was eye candy to behold.  The scenery and the amazing special affects were stunning.  I have not read the books, and frankly, I don't want to now.  I was so bored.  I almost began to cry.  I felt trapped in a movie which went from one foe to the next...to the next....to the next....to the next.....to the next....to the next.....to the next....and on and on and on, so long that when the main character noted \"I wish the ring had never found me,\" I agreed.  As the movie progressed different foes and challenges popped up as though they just magically appeared--Oh look we are stuck in these frigid mountains, no where to go.......it is OH so cold....what do we do? Oh, I know, lets take these mines here that just conveniently randomly appeared!  If you've read the books, you might enjoy the closeness, as I hear it has.  However, if you haven't...don't bother.  It is TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long...TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring....and TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO plotless....and all this, for 3 hours and 10 minutes...and then, then THEN!!!  NOTHING!!!!! Wait until you can set aside 9 hours and watch them all at once, then at least it might be slightly rewarding.",

I just had to decrease the volume to 5% most of the time because Jeniffer would cry and scream every 2 minutes which makes the movie really tedious and hard to follow. From the strory point of view, also the story is again too much Jeniffer centered. I wished to see more of Android universe, and how they live or how their world works. Some character building on their side! Overall I think if Netflix want to conquer the sci-fi market it should go for better actors and directors who know this genre better.",

Think Halo but even more action at it's best. She doesn't trust AI but slowly learns to trust the AI she is forced to work with and develops a bond that grows throughout, and I enjoyed that.I think many Netflix movies get unfairly rated poorly and of course anything starring JLo will as well. As usual, it wouldn't surprise me if the very low ratings came from people who didn't even watch it. I really don't feel if I was going to give something a 4 or lower, I would even continuing watching it and didn't feel I could give a fair review (unless I was in a theater with friends or family and had to sit through a movie I hated).Anyway, if you like action and sci fi, and go in for some fun not expecting some masterpiece, I think you will definitely be entertained.",

Jennifer Lopez would not have been my first choice to star in this type of movie, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by her acting. The relationship between ai and humans got very well portrayed by Jennifer. I even almost shed a tear in the end of the movie. Having said this, I would say that there is a lot of untapped potential.

The other sci-fi issue or maybe a plot hole was the code the antagonist was trying to ge that turn him evil, who coded it? The mother? Or did he code it? If it was the mother, why? And how would he know? If it was him, well, why would he need to uploaded if he coded it?Second, the tactical issue: they had a bomb that could've wiped out their enemies, why go there then? Why did they get so close instead of just bombings them when they had no intentions of negotiating or anything?The total inconsistency in fights. At the beginning a handful of AI enemies killed dozens of soldiers in their mecha-suits, but at the end one mecha killed the entire AI army.But I could overlook this to, if the protagonist was cool. But she wasn't. All the professionally trained soldiers died, and she was the only one who survived, but also the only one who hadn't done the proper training, just lucky I guess. What kind of message is this? Don't prepare and really on your luck.But for me, what kills this movie is the final boss fight. Remember Terminator or Aliens? What made this movie's final showdown so epic was the larger than life enemy they had. They seemed impossible to defeat, in Terminator a human vs. Son almost invincible robot, in Aliens a human vs. A giant queen alien. In this movie there's a human in a 12' mecha suit, that single handedly killed the entire AI army despite being the first time she had use it and synchronize with it vs a regular size guy.

When an existential threat of true AI dominance arises, threatening human extinction, the protagonist bonds with an AI cohort, and fends off the uprising and destroys the AI central threat.This movie really wanted to be that movie, except in space with a female lead. There is real thing in Hollywood: you can steal a story if you change several key aesthetics. So, here we are.There are a lot of other problems. The most visible of which is Lopez. She's the kind of actress who some time ago encountered the nadir that many actors do: her status as a celebrity eclipsed her stature as an actress, and she began performing in a very packaged and self conscious way. When you can tell an actor is thinking about how they look in a film, that's not good.The other challenges? When a lead performer is as polarizing as Lopez there are many who will \"hate watch\" this, rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the imminent schadenfreude.It's further complicated that the director, Peyton (Andreas), is familiar enough with spectacle, but not masterful in putting together something that should be of epic scale.Add to those obstacles the glaringly apparent lack of originality in the script or character beats, and you have a patient that is Dead On Arrival.The script attempts to make the story of AI galactic domination relatable by focusing on Atlas's (Lopez) personal history with betrayal. Unfortunately it throws the entire weight of impending genocide out of orbit. It makes the trials of the protagonist feel small; and Lopez, not looking dirty enough or scarred enough, hits every mark we see coming from a mile away.Mark Strong, Simu Liu and other supporting cast members are saddled with similar story, plot and dialogue problems.What we get is another big splashy Netflix film that will be forgotten in a hurry; to be half-watched while doing chores or sitting on a plane.Bummer.",

I don't recall a time when this goal has been more difficult to achieve than after watching this latest from director Brad Peyton (San Andreas, 2015) and co-writers Leo Sardarian (\"StartUp\"), Aron Eli Coleite (\"Locke & Key\").Jennifer Lopez stars as Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant government analyst and expert on AI, especially on Harlan (Simu Liu, BARBIE), ominously deemed the world's first AI terrorist. We know Atlas is smart because she has a chess winning streak against the computer and she wears black frame eyeglasses. After an opening which features Earth in peril, we flash forward 28 years, where it's evolved into \"good AI\" versus \"evil AI\". Don't worry, Atlas is on the side of good, despite her constantly frazzled state (with perfect hair) and the personal (emotional) baggage she carries with her.After years of searching, Atlas discovers the location for Harlan, and General Boothe (Mark Strong, character actor extraordinaire) forms a team led by Colonel Elias Banks (Sterling K Brown, AMERICAN FICTION, 2023) to capture Harlan so his CPU can be studied. Of course, the mission doesn't go as planned and by the end, I was wondering which racked up the most points: explosions or Ms. Lopez's cringy acting moments. Terrible punchlines regarding a running coffee gag placed third in the competition. Since I admittedly search for positives in every movie, let's go with Simu Liu's unusual blue-eyed effect, the tight pants on Agent Atlas, and giant robotics that look like the one that went rogue in ROBOCOP (37 years ago). Apologies, but that's the best I can do for this one, other than to say we have an early Razzie frontrunner.On Netflix beginning May 24, 2024.",

            "text": "For the past couple of years, Netflix has been released a lot of Action Blockbusters onto their streaming service. There have been some great ones like the two Extraction Movies with Chris Hemsworth, but there's also been a number of them that have been bombing critically with critics and audiences. It's gotten to the point where no one cares or even talks about them and Atlas (2024) is yet another prime example of that trend. With all that being said, it's time to talk about the movie.Positives for Atlas (2024):\nIf you enjoy these Netflix Action Blockbusters, then you'll definitely enjoy this one. That's it for the positives.Negatives for Atlas (2024):\nFirst of all, the plot of this movie is one we've seen done a billion times before and done better in other movies. Also, you have Jennifer Lopez as the main protagonist of the movie and all I have to say is Why? I don't have anything against J-Lo, but she just doesn't fit this role, you could literally replace her with any other actor or actress and you would still have the same movie. The storyline between her character and this A. I. is as boring and generic as you would expect. Also, the movie completely wastes Sterling K. Brown, Simu Liu and Mark Strong. There's a lot more I could talk about, but it's the same old stuff in other Netflix Action Blockbusters.Overall, this is a movie that everyone will forget about and they'll be moving on with their lives. Netflix, could you please put some more effort into your Action Blockbusters I would greatly appreciate it.",

If they would have added another 10-20 millions to the budget for special effects, and improved the story a bit, to make it just a tad more nuanced and complicated it would be a hit. 8 -100%.

We have a cop who is frustrated with her life, she's an emotional mess, heavily addicted to coffee and falls a sleep on the couch regularly, living the bachelor's lifestyle. So your typical 80's and early 90s cop movie start but with a PG-13 rating.Our protagonist Atlas, is also a bit rash, hyper intelligent, she doesn't like to play by the rules, mistrusting, and is a bit to heavy handed. I really liked that this Hollywood trope and I've never seen this type character given to a female lead. Made the old trope fresher.I hate to say this, but this movie is a missed opportunity for a great sci-fi move. But it is sort of broken into two peaces. On one side it's a real deal sci-fi, and on the other it's a pure action movie. And a lot of this action could have been cut out to explore more sciency stuffs.For you who like a character driven plot, you might like this movie. Our protagonist is forced to go on an extremely dangerous mission, and in order to save her life and accomplish her life's mission, she has to learn to trust an AI robot, and grow as a person.There are some serious issues in this movie, on how technology works, based on the information the audience is given, and a few highly derivative scenes designed to keep the character narrative progressing forward...but it is a movie, and not a book.I looked at a few reviews, and I was very surprised at the hate on Jenifer Lopez. I have never been into pop culture and didn't realize who the lead was until I looked at the IMBD actors list. I personally think she did a great job, looked great with the new hairstyle, and playing a different character. She is very likable. So, my point is I have no idea why she is despised by so many reviewers...? Perhaps, she made some insensitive comments in the pop literature? I just don't know.Overall, this could have been a very serious sci-fi movie, but the direction opted for an action movie instead. So grab a beers or a wine bottle, put you thinking cap do the side, and enjoy the pretty ride.",

I loved how everything felt like a rock 'n' roll fest.I love dystopian movies, but you don't have to be a fan to recognize how amazing this was. It's a story of survival in a savage wasteland, every scene felt epic. I liked the cult-like nature and how they glorified their deaths like they were Vikings. Everything was eccentric and crazy, with non-stop action for nearly the whole movie.It's really dystopian and wild, so it's surprising that this was actually a mainstream hit. \"Do not become addicted to water\" was such a wild statement, lol.The premise is very simple; I don't think I can think of a more simplistic movie that worked so well. They drive out into the desert, then make a U-turn back to where they came from. That's it. And it's a blast. This is my favorite action movie, jam-packed with crazy sequences.The movie is really just one huge dystopian action sequence, so I guess the drawback could be that it's all action. If you're looking for something more, you won't find much. Apparently, Mad Max lore has some complex and darker elements, and maybe the upcoming Furiosa will delve deeper into that.Furiosa was probably the main character; it felt like Mad Max himself was just tagging along. The villain, Immortan Joe, was great. All the characters are memorable. And because the premise is so simple and the movie is so action-packed, it feels shorter than it actually is. It's just great fun and keeps me glued to the screen. Looking forward to Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.",

Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",

Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.I've also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There's no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It's not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron's character. I didn't think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn't terrible. He just didn't lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!",

It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film.",

            "text": "George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '\"wives\" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.",

            "text": "Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on. Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.",

Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered.

Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it. At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time. I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it. NOTE: \"Don't waste your time if you have seen the original.\" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015! Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.",

Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful. The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film. I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",

There are a lot of MENTIONS of things that never actually get explained AND THIS IS MY PROBLEM.Who is Immortan Joe?\nWhy does he look like that?\nHow did he wind up controlling all the water?\nWhy are they drinking breast milk?\nWhy are the boys called \"half-lives\" and dressed like skeletons?\nWhy do they need \"blood bags\"?\nWhat is with the silver teeth thing?\nWhat is all this Valhalla, shiny, chrome, what?\nWhy do they have a vehicle that spits fire with a dude playing electric guitar on it?\nHow did Furiosa lose her arm?\nWho was Furiosa to Joe?\nWHO DID KILL THE WORLD? (they keep asking and it never gets answered even a little bit)I had to look it up ... and I hate when movies don't explain things to the point where I have to look them up. That's what is called BAD STORYTELLING.I won't spoil it by telling you what was there but there is SO MUCH CRAZY INFORMATION that the movie just left out to make room for more fighting and chase scenes. This movie is 2 hours long and they couldn't fit any more story into it?Sorry guys ... that's some bad bad writing.",

It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",

The acting was great, especially from Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy of course. There were very few moments that felt weird or out of place unlike the third installment in the franchise.The visuals have never been better in the franchise and the cinematography is still most impressive. Speaking of most impressive things there was an amazing reference to Star Wars. Immortan Joe's car made a strange sound which was used before in the Millennium Falcon, when it could not start.I hope we get a sequel, but if they finish off Max's story here, I'm satisfied.",

This movie also feels so fresh and in my mind, it is even way better than the original movies. The cast assembly of this main characters is also fantastic, Tom Hardy did amazing as the main man himself (Max), Charlize Theron did amazing as (Furiosa) and Nicholas Hoult was awesome as this character (Nux).Sure the movie isn´t exactly that realistic, but for what its worth, then i think it is actually awesome that they really didn´t try to go for the normal approach, but that they went there own way and created this masterful over the top reboot/remake of the also phenomenal original Mad Max movies.To every person who loves crazy over the top and not too serious action blockbusters, then this movie is definitely for you!!!!(9/10)",

            "text": "Fury Road is a near perfect movie. It may be the best Mad Max film from a story perspective, and almost definitely the best from a technical perspective.As far as the pre-production work goes, the smooth camera focus from shot to shot, the frantic way scenes are filmed, the risky and flawless stunt choreography, the vehicle designs, costumes, and settings are all executed and established brilliantly. For the post-production work, the filters for day and night are awe-inspiring, with the night being so uniquely illuminated and the day looking so otherworldly yet familiar with the colours standing out and blending simultaneously as well as how the explosions appearing as if they're bleeding into the screen. The CGI effects are used sparingly and effectively, looking as convincing as they need to be. The score supports the thrills and emotions present throughout in the terrifyingly insane world the characters inhabit. Speaking of, the performances are all top notch, no particular favourites as everyone seemed to be doing their part wonderfully, from the main players like Max and Furiosa to the side characters like Slit and Rictus, everyone. The story is essentially one big escape and pursuit, executed in an effectively efficient manner.Honestly aside from one or two easily overlooked plotholes there's nothing I can really say to discredit this movie. The only thing I could say is that Max doesn't really feel like the main character until closer to the end of the movie but that's kinda just it.Overall, I'm probably not thinking of everything I enjoyed about this film, but that's just because there is so much to love. Fury Road is perhaps the best action movie of the decade.",

            "text": "Prior to this review, I had never seen any of the Mad Max Movies, but with Furiosa coming out next week, I decided to finally watch all of the Mad Max Movies. I enjoyed the three Mad Max Movies with The Road Warrior being my favorite and Beyond Thunderdome being my least favorite, while still having some fun of it. Now that road has led me to Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) and I'm just gonna say it, Fury Road is not only the best Mad Max Movie, but it is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie is a prime example on how to an established and beloved franchise from the 70s, 80s and 90s into the 21st Century perfectly.First of all, the action and stunt work is the best that it's ever been and that's saying a lot given the fact that all four of these movies were written and directed by George Miller. This is a 2-hour movie where for the entire runtime it's just non-stop kick-ass action chase sequence and Miller pulls it off perfectly. The performances are all top-notch, there is not one person who isn't delivering off the top of their talent, but the standouts are of course Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron as Max Rockatansky and Imperator Furiosa respectively. Now as much as I did enjoy Mel Gibson as Max, Tom Hardy just takes this character to a whole new level to the point where I prefer Hardy ocer Gibson. The thing that makes Hardy's version of Max stand out is the fact that for almost the entire first hour of the movie, he has no dialogue and yet Hardy is able to bring out a lot of emotion throughout that first hour with his actions and eyes. Now, let's talk about Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, this character is given so much emotion throughout her mission and journey back to her home to the point where I understand why they're doing a prequel to explore this character's backstory with Anya Taylor-Joy this year. Also, Furiosa is the prime example on how to do a strong female character properly.Overall, if you haven't seen Fury Road or any of the other Mad Max Movies in general, then what are you doing with your life, you need to watch these movies as soon as possible. Fury Road is not only an absolute instant classic of the action genre, but it is God-Tier Cinema at its finest.",

From the get go, there's action and it is long, and masterfully executed. It does what every action movie should do. The action keeps you on the edge of your seats biting on your nails the whole time. Also the background score was very well composed and really immersed us in the movie. You can't expect too much character development from an action movie but this movie manages to excel in that regard too. It really makes you see it from a different pov when you watch this after Furiosa.",

From the very beginning to the last scene, I was completely immersed in this wild and intense world created by George Miller. I think this movie is a real masterpiece, and it's not hard to see why.The cinematography is breathtaking, the best I've seen in an action movie. Every scene is carefully shot and choreographed, resulting in a visual spectacle that's simply stunning. The deserts, cars, costumes, character looks, and color contrasts make this world unforgettable. It's one of those rare movies where every frame could be in an art gallery.The soundtrack is amazing, taking the action to a whole new level. Every beat drives the story and the intensity of the action scenes, pumping up the excitement to the max. It's a truly unforgettable auditory experience.And as for the story, I'd call it simple but spectacular. George Miller tells an exciting tale at a fast pace that never lets the audience rest. From the moment the action kicks off to the climax, there's not a dull moment. It's a rollercoaster that keeps us glued to the screen from start to finish.But it's in the action scenes where the movie really shines. They're all simply epic, the most mind-blowing I've ever seen in cinema. The fight choreography and the car chases are masterful and breathtaking. Every stunt and explosion is done in an unmatched way.In the end, \"Mad Max: Fury Road\" is more than just an action movie; it's an example of how to create a true cinematic masterpiece. It's one of those rare films that manages to be both visually stunning and narratively engaging. Alongside \"Terminator 2,\" it's without a doubt one of the best action movies I've ever seen and an experience that no one should miss.",

The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances.

It's based on the plot of driving a straight line for half the movie. Then realising they cant continue to then turn around, and drive back for the rest of the film. Meanwhile basically being on constant fight scenes along the way. Even so, most fight scenes are quite poorly filmed. The director used odd angles.

A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",

They weave compelling stories of average everymen surround by a hostile landscape where it's every man for himself and only the cruelest and most heartless survive . George Miller's MAD MAX films are an extention of this . Low brow cinematic spectacle but fair as entertainment goes . And let's not forget hugely influential as well . Sadly the films' influence found itself being transplanted in nearly every post apocalypse story for the next 20 years where a brooding loner , a man of few words , drives through a desert landscape doing his best to survive in a hostile world against scavengers . Influntial but rather unimaginative and the movies probably did the sub-genre more harm than good . This reboot did capture my imagination via the trailers and so decided to give the film a chance , not least because as soon as it was released it shot to number 25 on the IMDb Top 250 If nothing else the film gets off with a bang with the eponymous Max filling us in via voice over that the world has destroyed itself and man has to fight to stay alive against his fellow man and just to prove this is more difficult than it sounds we're treated to a high octane chase sequence replete with fast camera action and editing . Have I mentioned the opening title credits haven't appeared yet ? This sets up the rest of the film that continues in mainly the same way In short if you liked MAD MAX 2 you're going to love this one because this is MAD MAX 2 on a fatal cocaine overdose which is a great thing or a disappointing thing depending on how you look on it . Sadly I'm in the second camp because I wanted more meat on the story and there's not much narrative here . Max gets used as a gimp on the front of a vehicle , manages to escape during an epic stunt sequence , teams up with some fair nymphet maidens and protects them from the baddies and that's it as far as plot goes . The first half of the film is basically one elongated noisy chase sequence full of stunts , car crashes , pyrotechnics . I's brash , noisy and spectacular , so much so that I actually felt myself getting rather bored by all this noise and bluster . Eventually the film does settle down a bit and has characters talking in normal tones without the explosions in the background but the dialogue is just basic as are the performances , Certainly MAD MAX FURY ROAD will be up for a few Oscar noms next year but only for the technical aspects and I'm slightly surprised my IMDb peers rate it so highly",

George Miller got his wet dream I suppose to make this movie, I am sure the budget was 50x more than he got in his previous Max movies. Well George, sometimes less is more. Sometimes it's better to have some constraints, just look at Quentin Tarantino. As soon as he got lots of money his movies became over long, self indulgent messes. George seemed to have listened to all the praise about how good the ending chase scene was in The Road Warrior so he made a movie of just that. Well that's like a meal of just cake. It may feel good going down, but it doesn't sit well. What made the last 15 minutes of TRW so good is the previous hour and a half of plot and character build up, without that it does not have same effect, no matter how many explosions and insane stunts you throw at the screen, it just numbs the brain. Miller stated that 90% of the movie was practical stunts but I find this hard to believe. I saw a LOT of CGI.This movie has no charm, no feeling of engagement, and very little sense of realism. People fly through the air crash on the ground with barely a scratch. Max has his leg brace but runs around like a football player. Some pale faced kid needs a \"blood bag\" for blood transfusions and then suddenly he doesn't? And old lady shoves a shell casing in someones eye? A guy is wearing a mask rips his face off when yanked off? Whatever happened to the idea that things like gasoline and bullets are rare in post apocalypse? Where are these things being manufactured? Oh well I guess you are supposed to ask these questions, just enjoy the explosions and the women being...uhm...milked.Charlize Theron is good but based on interviews she had no idea what she was doing and to me it shows, she cries when she is told to but her character is poorly developed. We get her back story and then 5 minutes later she has this big breakdown, which has no weight to it. The movie would have been better with fewer characters, cut out the nux kid and the old ladies and just focus on Furiosa and Max. And while we are at it, this movie is called Mad Max, not Mad Charlize, why does he seem like a side character? And why show his beloved last of the V8 interceptors and crash it 1 minute later? And his character just didn't feel like Max, Max was the coolest of the cool with a tinge of a maniac, this guy is all frantic and comes across as just another action hero. This movie had some potential to be epic, but it needed more balance, a better script and more realism. Movies have become rides.",

Our characters are held at gunpoint in a nail - biting confrontation. The motives of the two soldiers are murky at first, but it's gradually revealed that they're both massive bigots, and shoot dead two characters of colour in cold blood. The quiet, slow - burn tension of the scene instantly dissipates, escalating into a literally incomprehensible shouting match, before a van (which they should've heard coming) barges in, hitting and incapacitating the two foes, giving our characters a way out. Almost literally as subtle as a truck driving through the script. Nothing more is revealed about the two soldiers.A harrowing scene with no answers and no sense of closure, just like the entire movie. 'Civil War' is a film with nothing to say. Its only interest is in beating your over the head with a series of atrocities, which escalate in the final act, like the scene's ending. The film was on the radar of cinephiles for a while before release, and many speculated that it might be controversial, portraying a war - torn America during a divisive election year. Alex Garland stated in an interview that the film wasn't political, which I think should've been seen as a massive red flag. It's not remotely interested in exploring the underlying causes of division and conflict, or the policy positions which forced America to turn against itself in this universe.Why do I need to see so many horrors? You've already showed me 5 war crimes / cold - blooded executions. I don't need to see 20 more. This is the only card which the film has to play. There's no optimism. No hope or lessons for the future. No answers. It's a downwards spiral all the way to the end.You know what would've made for a more interesting resolution to the Jesse Plemons scene? How do you talk your way out of this situation? How do you reason with someone like that? This is the question that could actually have a helpful application to our real - world divisions; you can't resolve disagreements by hitting people with vans.I would've preferred to see a prequel, which explores the beginning of the war, and the specific issues and ideologies which split the nation. A more ideas - driven film, which has something to say about how we can de - escalate and avoid division.",

With everything that's been going on, it seems like it's for the best.Basically the film takes the same attitude as the shop assistant. They are combat journalists trying to speak to the President. They are not embedded as one synopsis said. If they were we might actually see the civil war. If it wasn't for the Presidential broadcast, as in the trailer, and the Western Forces flag (like the US flag but only 2 stars) it could have been anywhere and any war. The trailer suggests you're going to see the civil war. The journalists are wandering around. They take pictures of burnt out cares and sometimes combat. It's not explained who's fighting who and why. They encounter the \"what type of American are you?\" guy and the \"We're shooting at someone because they're shooting at us\" guys. Neither of these are directly part of the civil war. They're not on either side. In other words it's just a film that's anti-war but done in such a slow way that I was thinking of calling this review \"recommended for insomniacs\". Watching the trailer you'd think there was constant battle throughout the film. I'm really tempted to say that the only combat scenes in the film are the ones in the trailer but that would be unfair. The ending battle is pretty good but I do think you'd end up with a 30 minute film if you took out all the chatting in the van. It's an anti-war film that doesn't make its point.

Taking photos of people while they suffer and die is obscene and the pain and gore of violence was trivialised, not dignified by this sad movie.",

Yes, there are a few issues with the premise, the idea that California and Texas would team up against other parts of the US - having lived in Texas and Cali I know they're two very different states.However, the real problem with this movie is that the title is really click bait. I was expecting a film about a civil war in the US, but what I got was a really really slow movie about a war photographer and an aspiring war photographer on a road trip that happen to bump into a few looney rednecks.All in, I was genuinely bored through most of this movie. I remember looking around the cinema thinking how many empty seats there were and, ah so that's where the speakers are!The movie only really becomes more action packed toward the last quarter. The ending scene is pretty good, there are some excellent battle scenes, and it's more shocking that it's blue on blue. In fairness the last 20 minutes has some of the best battle scenes I've seen, hence I gave this movie a 6 as the last 20 minutes literally saved this film from being a solid 2.So, other than the last 20 minutes battle, what is this movie really about? Well, it's about a seasoned war photographer who encounters some new 'kid' photographer that wants to learn the craft. The backdrop of the civil war is never explained. You have no idea who is the 'good side' and who is the 'bad side'. You don't know why it happened, who to root for, how big the sides are. Because of that, this literally could have been a movie about a war photographer in Rwanda or Serbia. It's also very slow imo. It's largely a road trip across parts of the US in which the photographers and journalists drive through towns and meet small numbers of looney people with guns - think The Walking Dead on a slow episode.The worst thing about it is the story arc is predictable. You can pretty much guess where this is going to lead, spoiler, the old veteran photographer who won't risk anything to help the young upstart risks everything I was pretty much eye rolling in the final moments because it was very obvious what was going to happen.Overall, I felt cheated - it was bait and switch. I thought I was getting something intense, some deeply thought out civil war in the US movie, characters on either side you could root for, but no, just a bit silly road trip, with the last 20 minutes giving the movie a very visually impactful battle scene.",

For a political movie this was a bold, bland, and terrible choice. This needed less fence-sitting and more big swings. You can't make a political movie and then not take any political stances, even in the form of good vs evil being two different political ideologies in a fictional version of the U. S.With that being said, there were some very compelling scenes that left me on the edge of my seat and clambering for more. Especially the scene where Jesse Plemons makes his appearance. This along with the scene driving through the burning forest were my favorites of the film. An honorable mention is the entire fight to get into the white house during the DC scene, which had me so anxious and stressed that I was almost feeling nauseous (in a good way of course).The sound design was impeccable and it had me feeling like I was in every scene with the characters, especially the gunfight moments. Another impactful point was the use of silence during emotive scenes, most notably in the moment we see Joe screaming while the helicopters are taking off and when he and Jesse are in the back seat having a breakdown.A criticism I have is that it follows the overused trend of the last decade of post-apocalyptic feeling sets for a story that doesn't require it. The traveling across desolate America and stopping at every small encounter with another person just made me think I was watching a rip off of The Last of Us.This movie was good, but it could have been so much better. It could have done with being a solid 2:30 instead of 1:49 in run time. The pacing would have been better, more of the world building could have been established, and the introduction of what the stakes actually were for each side in the war could have been stated. But we got none of that.I wish this was better than it was, I truly do. I am giving it a very soft 6/10 with the possibility of it being lower after a repeat viewing in the future.

Pure nonsense. Additionally, they are covering a small skirmish with people wearing plain clothes and minimal body armor, while the journalists are fully vested and wearing helmets, then at the end of the film when they are covering fully soldiers, with equipment aplenty, the journalists are wearing minimal gear. A lot of small plotlines and basic story points werent fully developed and kept taking me out of the film. Was looking forward to this too and was sadly disappointed.The cinematography was great, although the lenses they shot on had a lot of chromatic aberrations which were distracting because they were wide open a lot of the time. The editing was great and never felt like it lingered too long on any shots.

Like a serum for snake bite made of venom itself, this film grabs us by the shoulders and screams \"You got a civil war fantasy? Fine, I'll put it on a 40 foot screen and dare you to cheer.\"Civil War finds it's foundational vision in the eyes of those who for decades have brought us the soul shattering reality of war, free from the romance of Hollywood patriotism- war journalists whose frenzied, conflicted oddysey plunges them into a mad gauntlet of fire and film, killing and kodachrome. Like soldiers in a war of attrition, they must constantly reassess the purpose of thier risks and sacrifices as they watch their colleagues fall for the sake of the priceless pictoral story of war. Three generations of war correspondants traveling together into the insanity becomes the testiment to three phases in the life of such a calling.We are introduced to the strangeness of how soldiers, out for blood, tolerate and facilitate the prescence of these unarmored observers every step of the way through the hell of combat. Garland seems to tap into some unspoken ethos of universal creedance among combatants that the history of it all must be seen and those who record it must survive to tell of it. It is never explained, merely displayed.We are reminded that in a modern Americn civil war, rogue atrocity can roll through your city just as easy as it did for My Lai. If you think that in the fog of war we would maintain our civility and morality like gentlemen, think again. For every five patriots there might be one psychopath ready to fill ditches with the innocent dead executed under the jurisprudence of a few unhinged men with guns.We have no idea why this war is being fought. Perhaps it is a just war. Perhaps it is a crazed cessationist rebellion. We aren't afforded such information. It would only get in the way of the vital message-war is hell and be careful when you tell your fellow American to go to hell for thier political differences. What you end up with might be far darker and damning than you ever dreamed.The genius of this film rests partially in an absurd alliance between California and Texas, two of the most opposite states in the Union. By joining this ideological odd couple, the story immunizes itself against accusations of partisanship or cultural favortism. Yet it also beckons us to imagine what kind of national crisis could bring such opposites together.This film will be awarded there is no doubt.

It's a bit odd that there's no explanation at all about how the USA has found itself in a civil war or as to why the president is ultimately portrayed as such an unsympathetic character but that is ok too since it's really all about the journey of the central characters. As to those characters, they're somewhat stereotypical. You've got the photo hack who's seen all the horrors of war ( in case we didn't get this we are shown a sequence of her reminiscences) there's the ingenue and, as is normal, the hero's reluctance to take her on board and the usual mix of support. In the end you have the new girl getting on with business and proving that she's the real deal. If the characters are a bit cliche'd, the dialogue hardly helps with lines like (I'm paraphrasing because I can't recall exactly but something like) \"I've never felt so scared in my life, but I've never felt more alive\".

The trailers were kind of awful marketing imo. This is a character-driven story, but in the most tense way possible. Anything can happen at any moment, and the left swerves are constant. I have to stress that OH MY GOD you have to see this on the big screen! It's one of the most immersive films I've ever seen-I wasn't pulled out of it for even a second and it is so bloody beautiful!I should not have loved this movie, but I did, because it has some truly wild universal implications-it's not limited to the US at all. I had to take a long time to process this film, but I understand the breathless first reactions: this is not like anything I've seen before, for one particular reason. I also totally get the Apocalypse Now comparisons: now there's another film that contradicted each impulse it put out. One might say that by nullifying itself it too was \"empty\"-but of course it wasn't. This movie is pretty meta: what I think and say will say a lot about me and how I see the world. That's super cool! But it's not about war (outside of being an anti-war film). It's about war journalism, and spectacle.A lack of context might annoy people. And why? Well, frankly, because this is a movie that is opposed to American exceptionalism. It aggressively shoves your face in its sameness actually. It renders it banal; a war zone like any other country in another war film where most American viewers likely have little idea of the opposing parties or actors involved. Every gun shot is loud as hell, every explosion is far too much: spectacle, yes, and people ask \"to what end?\" I find it radical. One can make up five different backstories of how Texas and California seceded separately and then allied against a fascist President: but the only reason you'd have a problem with the fact that Civil War doesn't tell you is because you're too attached to the American-ness of it all. America? Depicted like any other? The cheek! Jesse Plemons' character heavily evokes the Khmer Rouge. There's so many other examples-they remind you of somewhere else (Vietcong references, Afghanistan/Iraq imagery, less domestic parallels than international ones tbh). I admire the provocation to us Americans, I really do. This film is about the spectacle of war and how it would look today: literally any war, anywhere, and here! And it's using the most provocative, iconic setting to do that.The performances are OFF THE WALL. Dunst is phenomenal, she's the whole-ass movie! We've literally never seen this from her before, and damn, that range. One doesn't doubt her as Lee, a veteran war photographer, for a moment, even though she barely says anything. It's saying a lot that this is up there amongst her best work. Hell, it's one of the best performances of this whole decade. The whole movie plays out through her reactions and tonally she's pitched it perfectly. And Wagner Moura is almost equally brilliant (it could reasonably be considered a co-lead performance imo): his Joel is chaotic, wild, and hedonistic. The depiction of war journalists is so precise: the bizarre, adrenaline-fueling addiction that it seems to require. It's devastating. The film explores the ethics of reporting: where it ends is not stated, but it is clear. In Moura's scream, in Dunst's eyes, in Stephen McKinley Henderson's beautifully wise tone, and then in Spaeny's reverse-mirroring her idol's journey. The score was appropriately surreal, the needle-drops brilliant (deep cuts!), all the techs are undeniably in sync. None of this would've worked without this ensemble, and Dunst in particular. They're not just the characters: they're the whole point of the film.One might ask: How stupid does Alex Garland have to be to make a film so pointedly open to all the criticism? He knows people will call it \"empty\", lacking in a \"political stance.\" He knows people will find it bombastic, or that because we're thrown into the deep end, no amount of character shading and performance work will prevent people from saying things like \"thin characterization\". But Lee, Joel & Sammy (McKinley Henderson) are razor-sharp. Jessie (Spaeny) is the real enigma. I think for Garland, this setting was the only vehicle through which there might be an actual jolt, and he wasn't wrong. The setting is familiar *globally*: what better setting to choose than the icons of a global superpower most people in the world are familiar with? This might seem like a step too far as comparison but people across the world were just as shocked as anyone when the towers went down on 9/11. Why? Because they wondered: it could happen there too? Really?! Garland's somehow made a film that feels real enough to evoke that shock.I kept thinking with every second I would soon say it's exploitative. But this movie doesn't allow any feel-good triumphalism. It's dark & terrifying. This is the sheer dread and despair of war: there is no questioning that the film is staunchly anti-war: the cost of it all feels so palpable. The aesthetic of this film and the strong emotion it elicits-all clearly intended-is more than enough for me to run with. I would've definitely been annoyed if it had been too definitive. This is an anti-war, anti-exceptionalism film about the nature of telling the truth about war. It's a masterpiece, it just is.",

The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist \"Lee\" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort \"Joel\" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate \"Sammy\" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer \"Jessie\" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his \"always take fuel when you can\" or \"this way only leads to death\" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue \"Press\" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up. It's bitty, episodic, unrealistic and populated with characters in whom I simply could not believe.

What promised to be an intense, character-driven drama devolved into a shallow portrayal that lacked genuine development or emotional weight.Despite positive reviews and pre-release hype, \"Civil War\" ultimately felt like clickbait - a flashy exterior with little substance. It failed to live up to the promise of a cinematic masterpiece, leaving me with a sense of disappointment.

He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...",

            "text": "The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.\nBehind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (\"Keep your friends close .....\", \"I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies\"), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.",

            "text": "\"The Godfather, Part II\" is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "text": "Nino Rota's musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rota's music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone family's many criminal actions, we understand that one doesn't have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We don't look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vito's father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vito's older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vito's hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vito's damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vito's sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, \"You once told me: 'In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.' That was seven years ago.\" What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. It's like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michael's desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the film's closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what could've been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, \"It had nothing to do with business.\" The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once.",

Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana.

A film like \"The Matrix Reloaded\" is a sequel - \"The Godfather Part II\" is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in \"The Godfather Part II,\" Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. \"The Godfather\" was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. \"The Godfather Part II\" may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a \"sequel\" almost seems insulting.",

Just look at the IMDb rating and you'll see I'm not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone's life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.",

            "text": "OK. Let's get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. I'm not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didn't like it. Here's the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michael's house, and the build up for young Vito's story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs weren't as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.Al Pacino's performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasn't that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesn't make sense. In the book, it's clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesn't kill anyone from his own family (not \"the Family\", the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but let's remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Don's daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. It's interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppola's anatomy for each \"Godfather\". You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasn't's that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.Another flaw I found was that the story doesn't really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didn't even appear in Mario Puzo's novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesn't even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassino's condition from the first.Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a die hard fan of \"The Godfather\". I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesn't do it for me.",

So take this review with a grain of salt: I'm an outsider, definitely.I kinda liked the first Godfather, while not considering it as great cinema I found it engaging, well put together, with strong moments, all in all a good movie. Not so here. To me this was excruciatingly boring.I actually liked the overture scenes very much. Then we leave Italy for the USA, and after 40 minutes I was still waiting for something to vaguely interest me. These endless contrived stories about the Italian Mafia (mob) have become such a cliché in movies that it's impossible for me to attend all this convoluted, ultra-codified stuff without getting successively amused, then annoyed, then plain bored. So when the cinematic and staging aspects are great, like in SCARFACE or ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, I just take that stuff for what it is, a genre film bound by rules, and enjoy it from the great acting, direction and purely cinematic elements (in De Palma's case -Scarface- the fabulous camera eye, in Leone's case -Once upon a time- the mindblowing psychological staging and the terrific cinematography).Here the staging is mostly sloppy, long parts of the movie feels like it's been produced too fast, with poor cinematography and loose acting, some others are just as good as in the first movie but they're too scarce.Pretty average, exploitative, complacent stuff for me. Sorry, I've seen so many movies that I need much more than that to be impressed. As far as classics goes, I'd rather watch \"12 angry men\" or \"Le Procès\" for the 30rd time than another of these cliché-ridden mob movies.",

The best part is when Michael hugs Fredo during their mother's funeral and they seem to have forgotten what had happened but the look Michael gives to Al Neri we know that Michael is going to kill Fredo. This part shows us the true haunting nature of Michael. And the part when Anthony is called by Connie and Fredo says to him that he will catch a fish for Anthony and Al Neri smiles at the back making it feel normal but we knowing what is behind the smile is haunting.\nEverything about this movie is perfect!

            "text": "The Godfather Part II is said by many to be the best sequel ever. I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I don't care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else he's ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacino's rival/friend/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I don't know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone who's family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleone's most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New York's underworld and is determined to avenge his family's death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michael's fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman.If there was one flaw this had, it would be that the antagonist in the sequel isn't much of a threat; we know Michael can destroy him and all he has. One reason the first one worked so well was because the family was losing and audience did not know how the family would regain power. That masterstroke isn't quite achieved in this. So maybe the first one is better.Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppola's direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great.4/4",

In the first GODFATHER, we saw Michael give up his dream of an honest life to save his family and lead it back to greatness.  Here, we see he sacrifices everything for his family, and in the end loses even that.At the same time, we see how Michael's father Vito became the great Don. Starting out by doing his family and his fellow immigrants a great favor by eliminating the brutish, terroristic Don Fannucci, Vito ends up merely replacing one tyrant with another in ANIMAL-FARM-like style.As we see Michael and Vito maneuver for power against their enemies (including Hyman Roth, excellently played by Lee Strasberg), we begin to wonder how much worse the mafiosi are than the government officials who surround them.  Their dishonesty and their violence would hardly be out of place in many \"legitimate\" governments throughout history, and in some cases even today.  As Michael tells a corrupt Senator played by G.D. Spradlin, \"we're both part of the same hypocrisy.\"(Spoilers below).The ending of THE GODFATHER: PART II is one of the most poignant in history, as Michael's memory flashes back to a party before he joined the military. The scene contains four men besides himself: Santino, Fredo, Tessio, and Carlo.  All are dead now - three of them by Michael's own order.  As Tessio mentions that thousands of young men are enlisting to fight the Japanese after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Santino comments, \"They're saps, because they risk their lives for strangers.\"  Now Michael, having risked his life for his family for years, finds they are strangers to him who fear and loathe him.

I'm guessing that much of its popularity lies in the fact that it is not just a sequel, following Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) as he continues to expand his family's 'business', but also a prequel, charting Vito Corleone's life from a child in Sicily at the turn of the 20th century to powerful New York mafia don. Two films for the price of one!Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, only half of this 'double-bill' is really worth the time and effort. The flashbacks are great, with Robert De Niro superb as the young adult Vito, rising from shop assistant to mob boss; these parts reminded me of the excellent Once Upon A Time In America, which also charted the early lives of young gangsters (and which also starred De Niro). In contrast, the scenes featuring Michael's continuing underworld activities in the '50s are far too convoluted and slow for their own good, making keeping up with the Corleones more of a chore than a pleasure.8/10 for the flashbacks; 4/10 for the rest.

            "text": "At the time of its release, many claimed this to be a finer film than the original. However, the passage of time has been less kind to this than that iconic movie. Much of the problem stems from the decision to make this both the sequel and prequel to the first film at the same time. So we have the back story of Vito Corleone and the ongoing adventures of his son Michael inter-cut throughout. This adds to the films inordinate length, which would have been long enough if Michael's story alone was told, but here is stretched to almost 4 hours. Details in both stories fail to convince, the Vito back story most of all. It is scarcely believable that a well meaning outsider could so easily take over the underworld in the manner portrayed. As played by De Niro, he is a Robin Hood 'feared by the bad, loved by the good' but why he is so universally feared not plausible. He could have easily been taken out. The real Vito Corleone would have had to have been much nastier and been prepared to deal with his opponents brutally. His character is whitewashed for Hollywood consumption. And there is some cack handed attempts at humour during, for instance, the slum landlord scene. There is, of course much fine acting from all, especially in Michael's story arc. This differs from Vito's since while Vito's is very simple, Michael's is very very complex. Too complex perhap. Various well known events from the 50s merely are stuck together to form the backdrop. The Mafia involvement with pre-revolutionary Cuba; congressional hearings; plus a few subtle hints at the Kennedy assassination. The narrative is exceptionally loose and meandering. The writing is surprisingly unsubtle, with clinking plot points being underlined again and again. The female characters are under-used but make the most of their meagre parts. Talia Shire's impassioned plea to her brother sticks in the mind, but elsewhere she barely speaks a word. Diane Keen has a better role and sinks her teeth into it with gusto.The film belongs to Al Pacino who dominates this in the way that Hamlet does in Shakespeare's play. Its an accomplished performance as would be expected. There is certainly enough here to make it worth watching, but it could have been much better.",

            "text": "A sprawling Western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is a masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing.  In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.The three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified.  Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

            "text": "After many years of barely watching any movies, I treated myself to several classics recently. And this was the best.That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time. The setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order  all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns  the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad (\"Sentenza\") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good (\"Blondie\") and Ugly (\"Tuco\") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled  in many ways similar to Sentenza  but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced  by Sentenza's orders  to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard  it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.The plot was extremely clever  and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold  three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western cliché that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, \"Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done.\" The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:\"There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.\"\"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting.\" Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed: \"You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.\" In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences  never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.",

The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable. Initially aimed to be a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, continues to stand the test of time in its endeavor to attain apotheosis (if it hasn't attained it yet). It will always be remembered as European cinema's greatest lagniappe, not only to the Western genre, but to the world of cinema.It's a must watch for any movie lover. 10/10",

            "text": "This is the third,and arguably the best, of the so-called \"spaghetti western\" trilogy. It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series \"Rawhide\" when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film \"Dr. Zhivago\" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away. Don't rent it because you will not want to part with it once you've seen it.Then curl up with it on a cold, rainy Sunday afternoon when you are in no hurry to do anything.",

It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled. The theme song will forever be etched in your brain. In fact, it probably already is, even if you haven't seen the movie! The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song \"Ecstacy of Gold\" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting. There is not a single dull moment. The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as \"Angel Eyes.\" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as \"Blondie,\" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western. If you haven't seen this movie, stop what you are doing, and go get it now!!",

First off, may I say that Clint Eastwood... what a hottie in his day! :D Sorry, had to get that off my chest. Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's. I mean, I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical.Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy, drama, and war. The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic.

            "text": "Sergio Leone always wanted every picture he made to be, in every way, bigger than the one which preceded it. With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title \"the ugly\"  this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title \"the bad\", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title \"the good\"  obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.Leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs  exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films  are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith  given the treacherous and chequered nature of the \"good\"  but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme  Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here  it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it  they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art  he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting  Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said \"bad guy\" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital  it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the \"bad\" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.",

            "text": "...and though those last several words could also be attributed to Leone's \"Once Upon a Time\" films (West and America) as well as the other pieces in his trilogy of films with Clint Eastwood- Fistful of Dollars and For a Few More Dollars- arguably this is the most ambitious and spellbinding one of the bunch, and one that has inspired (i.e. Quentin Tarantino, Sam Raimi, Robert Rodriguez) and will most likely continue to inspire filmmakers and fans into the 21st century. There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan & scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.",

I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action.Ultimately, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.And to think, I missed all that the first time through...",

Nearly every great movie is carried by some drama between characters.Yes it has a little bit drama. It shows the greediness of humanity just like The Treasue of Sierra Madre. It refletcs conflicts between three different types of men. Also I love how Eastwood's character is nameless in The Man Without Name Trilogy. Sometimes the trilogy also called The Dollar Trilogy.Besides the storyline the techincs are breathtaking.Acting performances are just breathtaking. If you didn't notice that much of acting skills, then you should check Trivias of the movie.The Scores just one of the bests. Morricone just made the most iconic scores. From that time until now, every Western score has his iconic type.Set decoration is about something enormous in this movie. They really did something great with that too.Costume design and makeups are also so good. You can see it in the battle scenes and in the desert scenes.Sound is really good, the only decent thing is Film Editing. Especially in the Extended Versions some flaws appears.",

            "text": "Ok- first, as mentioned in another review, the geographic/historical errors in this film are GLARING. You've got men carrying revolvers that look like old style cap-and-ball pistols, but they're loading them with metallic cartridges- historically about five years early. Eastwood carries a rifle that hasn't been invented yet, Tuco assembles a \"superpistol\" out of a Colt, a Remington, and a Smith and Wesson- impossible. And there was nothing of merit taking place between the North and South during the Civil War in the Southwest. Now, that aside, I must say that this is the Greatest western ever. I first saw this film when I was about ten. I'd never sat through an entire Western befor, even though my Dad watched them constantly. Since then, I've been through film school, watched hundreds of Westerns, learned to appreciate them- but NOTHING matches up to this. The Searchers, Stagecoach, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, The Gunfighter, High Noon, Shane- all great films, but saddled with the standard American Western morality- the good guy never takes liberties with the eastern schoolmarm, the bad guy wears a black hat, etc. Coming from Italy, TG,TB &TU isn't bound by these conventions. Blondie's the \"good guy\"- but he's also a bounty hunter. He makes a living in a highly immoral way, but is obviously the \"good\"- not because we're told, but from small acts- giving the dying soldier a cigar, making sure the Captain knows to hold on till he hears the bridge blow, the genuine regret he feel for having to let Shorty die. And while Angel Eyes may be the Bad, we at least know he has prinicpals- when he's hired for a job, he always sees the job through. And Tuco may be more immoral than the other two, but he's so savvy and his role so humorous that one can't bring oneself to look upon him disfavorably. In other words, historical inaccuracies aside, TG, TB, & TU maybe one of the most accurate portrayals of the West ever put on film- there are no clear-cut lines of conduct, no black and white, or even grey, but just a swirled palette of various facets of the human condition.",

How do I remember a baseball game, it was the night Hank Aaron was going after Babe Ruth's homerun record. Baseball or a movie. Tuned into the the baseball game, flipped to the movie -a western, cool. 'Uh, what is this no one is talking it makes no sense'. After what seemed like an eternity somebody finally spoke, Lee van Cleef. The rest is Movie History. Since then I have seen this movie well over 25 times. Numerous lines that have been etched into my memory. Forget whatever minor flaws this movie has. Put yourself in the movie. Sergio Leon, John Ford these are the people that defined \"The Western\".

            "text": "One of the original Leone \"Italian Westerns\" that quickened the pulse of a young Quentin Tarantino.Sometimes I think I am living in a time warp. I watched all the Leone films in theatres in real time and was mesmerized, gob-smacked, and exhilarated. Now in the far future (2016) I watch QT do his knock-offs, and the young audiences (who have never seen the originals) think his are the originals, and everything else the knockoffs.(Reminds me of the Old King Cole nursery rhyme -- \"pulled out a plum and said What a Good Boy Am I\" -- another reference lost on those living the age of portable devices.) For those who actually care about the history of film: * Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His first, Fistful of Dollars, recycled a Japanese story (Yojimbo), recycled an American ex-pat whose Hollywood career was officially over (Eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era, Ennio Morricone.* next came For a Few Dollars More, an original story, which locked into film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing, and brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef, one of the greatest \"faces\" in the history of the western. (\"Angel Eyes\" in this one.) * with two international hits under his belt, Leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously continuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his second film, he gave Eli Wallach (an A-list star from the 1950s) the role of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the backdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an anti-war film at the same time! (The only film of Leone's that may compete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America, also reviewed by this writer on the IMDb).By modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in America (as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America), the \"suits\" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the rest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form.QT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. He used Morricone's music in Kill Bill (his best film in my view) and in my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but falls somewhat short.For you youngsters out there, I recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film, period. Imitated but not duplicated.Astonishing, mind-blowing, unforgettable.",

            "text": "Belfast-based comics writer Garth Ennis said it best: \"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend...those who dig Clint Eastwood movies...and dweebs.\" While I have to admit that my heart belongs to the opening act of \"The Man With No Name\" trilogy, \"A Fistful of Dollars\", there is no denial in my mind that \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is actually the better film. Many directors have tried imitating it's style (including Don Siegel's substandard \"Hang 'Em High\" and Eastwood's own first Western offering as star/director in \"High Plains Drifter\"), but none have truly come close to the eccentricities on display here.I have a suspicion that the storyline is actually based on historical fact. Consider this account from Joel Rose's \"The Big Book of Thugs\" under the entry of \"The Reynolds Gang\": They were organized in 1863 by Texans Jim and John Reynolds. They were briefly interned in a Civil War prison camp for Confederate sympathizers and after being released, began making robberies that, according to Jim Reynolds, were to help out Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy. The loot was buried somewhere in the area of Handcart Gulch and Spanish Peaks in Colarado Territory and later, after Jim Reynolds and four members of his gang had been executed by Colonel John M. Chivington of the Union Army, John Reynolds, dying from a fatal wound during a holdup, supposedly whispered out the location of his old gang's ill gotten loot. Unlike the movie version, it was never found.Regardless of whether or not this was the actual basis for TGTBATU, it is nevertheless a film more grounded in history than a lot of it's comtemparies and, indeed, more than a few of it's successors. The Civil War is part of the backdrop, but it does so on a forgotten front of that war, the Western theater. Most high-school history classes would have us believe that nothing happened out West, but plenty did. In fact, the last skirmish of the war, if I'm not mistaken, was in New Mexico and, ironically enough, a Confederate victory.The central of this film is greed. You don't just see it in the quest for the Confederate gold by Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. There are signs of it everywhere; in the hotel manager talking about how he'll be glad to get the Northerners in town for the money they'll bring in, Bill Carson appealing to Tuco's greed for a single sip of water, the gang of cutthroats who are systematically robbing the Confederate prisoners of their goods. Set up against the harsh desert backdrop, it exposes the ultimate folly of that greed (the best symbol of it perhaps being the cemetary where the gold is buried). A little over a decade before the Reagan era of \"Greed is healthy, greed is good\", this film provides the ultimate rebuttal to that argument. Greed has gotten just as many men killed, if not more, than patriotism ever did. Such a subtext makes \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" the cinematic child of John Huston's \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and the precursor to Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\".As great as Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are, there is one member of this team that pushs this film into the status of greatness: score writer Ennio Morricone. Not only does he manage to write one of the most recognized theme tunes on the planet, he also adds the extra tension needed to convey the drama with the necessary oomph, the best examples being in Blondie's torturous walk across the desert, Tuco's frantic search through the cemetary (my personal favorite and so good that Lucasarts did a slowed-down version of it for their western shooter, \"Outlaws\"), and, of course, the final three way shoot-out. He still composes scores for many other films to this day, I've been told. A good example of his most recent work would be the 1990 version of \"Hamlet\" starring Mel Gibson and directed by Franco Zefferelli. But I truly doubt that he'll ever be able to top the legendary work he did here.",

Everyone knows it, not everyone wants to accept it. \"Goodfellas\"--based on true events--explores the lives of gangsters, chronicling the events through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who gets involved with the Mafia at a young age and continues his \"career\" throughout the film.As he gets older, he marries and has children, but still works for the organized crime family, under mob boss Paulie (Paul Sorvino); and he is friends with Jimmy (Robert De Niro), a calm, steady gangster; and Tommy (Joe Pesci), a wild man with serious mental problems.Eventually Henry's life goes down the gutter, leading to drug abuse and paranoia, that leads to other unfortunate incidents that will be ruined if I type any more about them.\"Goodfellas\" is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's a tour de force of breathtaking images, witty scriptwriting, superb acting and realistic violence.Robert De Niro gives one of his best performances -- ever -- as Jimmy, even if he's not in the film as much as you might be lead to believe from the front cover.Joe Pesci is in this movie about as much as De Niro, maybe a bit more or less. But when he's on screen there's no doubting he's on screen--he's very hard to miss. A short, deranged, loud-mouthed man with something wrong in his head. Someone makes an insult toward him and he shoots them, and then laughs. It's quite disturbing. I am a huge fan of Pesci, and I tend to love his characters, but he really makes you feel sick towards his character in \"Goodfellas,\" while at the same time taking a strange liking to him. That just goes to show how good of an actor Pesci is.Ray Liotta is perfect as Henry Hill. I can't think of a better actor to play him. He captures a sense of innocence yet at the same time a feeling of violence. I love the scene where he walks over to a man's house with a regular expression on his face. \"What do you want, f&*^&?\" the man asks. Liotta continues walking, takes out a gun, and starts to continually beat the man in the skull with the butt of his gun. As Henry walks back to his car, his face is disturbing and his expression stays with you for a long, long time.Martin Scorsese is a brilliant director and his work here is fabulous; it's been recreated by other directors (namely Paul Thomas Anderson in \"Boogie Nights\") and there's a reason: it's great stuff. He totally deserved to receive Best Director in 1990, but of course he didn't. (Rumor has it the Academy frowns on Scorsese's use of racial slurs in his work. Oh boo hoo, get over it.)The movie is based on the true-crime memoirs of the real-life Henry Hill, whose novel with Nicholas Pileggi -- \"Wiseguys\" -- was adapted into a screenplay by Pileggi and Scorsese. The book itself was fantastic and insightful; the screenplay is even better. The dialogue is incredible.Anyway, \"Goodfellas\" has to be one of the best films I've ever seen--a true modern classic that will be remembered for what it is: One of the greatest tales told on screen. It's an offer you can't refuse!",

Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where \"The Godfather\" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. \"Goodfellas\" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series \"The Sopranos\", which debuted nine years after this movie was made.\"Goodfellas\" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the cocaine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss \"Big Paulie\" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to rape her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, \"made man\" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids' birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.",

I have always thought that Goodfellas was one of the greatest films ever made and set a landmark in the 90's or even in movie history. I bought Goodfellas last week and I got to watch the film a couple days ago. I really just couldn't lay my eyes off the film and everything about it was just simply worth watching. The acting was excellent, Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and other actors did great and almost all of the characters they portrayed were 100% accurate. The camera-work also was brilliant and Martin Scorsese does a beautiful job by putting excellent camera shots in his films and I give him high credit for that. The soundtrack too is one of the best soundtracks ever made and the song \"Layla,\" put chills down my spine of how great this song fitted the film. Overall, Martin Scorsese made his best film in my opinion and him and Nicholas Pileggi made an excellent and sharp script that made this, the greatest mob film still today.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+",

            "text": "\"GoodFellas\" may be the most important film of the 1990s in the fact that its incredible success led to some of the other great movies of the decade. Films like \"The Silence of the Lambs\", \"The Crying Game\", \"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Usual Suspects\", \"Fargo\", and \"L.A. Confidential\" would have likely never been made as well as they were without the influence of Scorsese's \"GoodFellas\".  The film is an intense study of a Mafia family over a 30-year stretch.  Ray Liotta plays the half-Irish, half-Sicilian kid from Brooklyn whose only dream is to be a gangster.  Although Liotta's story is at the heart of \"GoodFellas\", it is the supporting cast that is the film's calling card.  Robert DeNiro gives one of his greatest performances, Paul Sorvino is quietly effective, and Lorraine Bracco (in an Oscar-nominated role) does the best work of her career.  However, it is Joe Pesci (in his well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) who steals every scene as the one who does the \"dirty work\".  This is probably the definitive film in a decade that produced many film-noir styled classics.  5 stars out of 5.",

I don't get it. I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately.I finally know now why Ray Liotta is still around and still gets parts because I always found him a little obnoxious in roles and I never realized he single handedly headlined Goodfellas and is great at it. His character might be the only one in the film given any depth considering he is the narrator and focus of the film. Disgustingly Liotta got no nomination that year which is absurd because if this film deserved anything (which I don't think it did) Liotta's role was it. Robert Deniro commonly gets credit for the film as being the headliner which is also a bit absurd. He might be the big name for the film but his role was small. He didn't make a significant part in the film until a good hour into it and his role was small but he still certainly brought his Deniro class and style to the ensemble. I think they would have done better to focus more on his character and his relationship with Liotta's character. They had good chemistry but just when you wanted to see more...they moved on to something else. Joe Pesci was over the top insane, downright disturbed Tommy Devito. His performance in this film is legendary \"Oh you think I'm a clown?\" but to be perfectly honest he was ridiculous. His performance wasn't sincere or believable and he was downright annoying. He was loud and abrasive and his barrage of gratuitous language actually made the film less watchable and I am not against the use of four letter words in film but his was too much. Lorraine Bracco was quite good in her pre-Soprano role as Liotta's wife Karen who sticks with him through pretty much everything and has some powerfully emotional swings throughout the film. Paul Sorvino is good as the head of the mob family, Paulie, but he doesn't make an impact. You don't really believe anyone would respect him. He's quiet and laid back and basically hiding throughout most of the film. At least with Brando's Godfather he was an image, an icon, something you just were in awe of. The cast all work well together but their characters are so thinly written you just don't give a damn about a single one of them except maybe a little for Liotta's Jimmy Conway.I get that I'm in a severe minority speaking this way about this film and that director Martin Scorsese is like a god to some but I just didn't seem the talent in this film. Scorsese showed talent in The Departed and the cast was a million times better than Goodfellas and deserved all of it's acclaim but I personally think Goodfellas is more of a non-thinking man's mob movie where bloody brutal kills and 1000 times hearing the 'F' word would prompt a dull chuckle as though the audience were 10. No I am not trying to insult anyone I was just severely disappointed by this film after having expected a brilliant classic which I will say hands down is not the case. I suppose if you like the crime genre or moreso the gangster drama than you must see Goodfellas anyways but I can promise you there is FAR better out there than this average, poorly written film. 6/10",

My wife and I saw it a couple nights ago, for the first time, and it just pales in comparison to cinematic triumphs such as The Godfather movies or The Sopranos.As much as anything else, there are no likable characters. Part of the reason you could keep turning in to The Sopranos is that you could genuinely like and identify with the principals, despite their brutality and crimes. Here, you can't. None of the principals have any displayed virtues: at best, they're shallow and two-dimensional.Yes, the highly lauded soundtrack has many tunes. But if you're going to use the hoary old tactic of advancing pop tunes down the years to denote the march of time, could you not be so flamingly anachronistic as all of that? They were playing 40s tunes in the doo-wop era, 50s doo-wop post-British Invasion, 60s psychedelic pop in the 70s, and early Eric Clapton in the disco era. Get the freaking DATES right.Speaking of anachronisms, the film's jammed with them, and while it's superficially a glittering, gritty portrait of the wiseguy life and the wiseguy era, the goofs just overload. Cars too late for the year. Phones too late for the year. Livery too late for the year. Did Scorsese bother at all with accuracy and continuity, or did they just say \"Eh, get an old looking car out there.\" It pains me to read about how exacting and painstaking DeNiro was to get every aspect of Jimmy's personality true to life, exactly how the real Jimmy Burke did, in the middle of a blizzard of anachronisms.Most damning, there's just no dramatic tension. There's little by way of plot, little by way of suspense. The actors did good jobs with the material and direction they were given, but that's not remotely enough to sustain this seriously overrated flick.5/10.",

Two and a half hours later, I would say although I enjoyed it, I was expecting more. I guess this film, much like Martin Scorsese's also largely successful Wolf of Wall Street, just felt too linear. Slickly filmed, with a variety of film techniques such as the freeze-frames and narration. A wonderful cast full of amazing performances, most of all by Joe Pesci playing Tommy DeVitto. Incredible. Despite all this, it still felt like something was missing. Understandably this and WoWS are both based on true stories so they aren't blessed with the capability to add the twists and turns of a fictitious story, but it just felt that the movie went on, and on, until eventually it was over; without really too much of significance happening. We knew there would be shootings and deaths, this is a gangster film afterall, but any problem encountered was dealt with so easily that it no longer seemed a problem to begin with. Even in the final sequences where the main character had such a big decision to make, turning on his lifelong friends, somehow I barely felt anything. Perhaps another director could have squeezed more emotion out of those scenes and then, for me, this could be further up there, with the greatest films of all time that many have described this as.

As much as the true events of Henry's life have more than likely been dramatised and glamourised to a certain extent, the essence of this film IMO is that it is still a brilliantly damning portrayal of the characters and lifestyle of mobsters.The sham of the mafiosi is exposed - preaching loyalty, respect & principles - but when it comes down to it they are just two-bit criminals that'll stab each other in the back for money or power over others. Each of them has an inflated sense of self-worth and stature that comes with being a \"wiseguy\", breeding with it paranoia that others are not giving them the respect they deserve.An example is De Niro's portrayal of Jimmy Conway. His outward persona is that of a calm and reasonable nature. But really he is a paranoid killer who at the drop of a hat would kill even his closest associates for money. I use associates rather than friends, as their relationships are of tolerance rather than kinship. Distrust, hate and jealousy through the forced smiles. Interesting that given this, certain people envy their life-style and would have loved to have been a wiseguy. I personally couldn't think of anything worse that being tied for life with having to keep the likes of Tommy company, but whatever rocks your boat.

Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is a half-Irish, half-Italian who rises to prominence in Paul Cicero's (Paul Sorvino) Lucchese Crime Family along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci).  This is his story of hi-jacking, stealing, cheating, killing and finally drug dealing.  He makes no excuses about what he does. Simply put he is just doing business and trying to survive on the mean streets of New York City.  He explains the trials and tribulations of being a mobster and what it's like to have to do these things and live with the consequences.  Cicero, an aging old-time underboss, heads a dangerous and powerful organization that enjoys free reign over the neighborhood in which Hill lives and recruits him when he is only a kid to work for them and learn to \"score\" more specifically, the art of committing crime.  Hill quickly hooks up with veteran criminal Jimmy \"The Gent\" and his protege Tommy to hi-jack trucks from the Idlewild Airport.  This makes these three rich and respected in the underworld but there is a new game in town.  Narcotics. They quickly undertake this highly profitable business even though they know it is against the expressed rules of Paulie.  This combined with another serious rule violation and the score of a lifetime sets them up for their own possible demise.  Lorraine Bracco co-stars as Henry's wife.

            "text": "Goodfellas is a technically impressive film and interesting to review largely because of the huge following it has amongst film critics and Martin Scorsese fanatics alike, most of whom reverentially believe it is his best workand they may be correct.The story based on a novel by Nicholas Pileggi chronicles the rise through the ranks of the Mafia of Irish-Sicilian Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), who has always wanted to be a gangster since he was a kid, and finds his wish granted. We follow him from a rambunctious teen to his first arrest, his marriage to Jewish wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) through to their fall into drugs, and finally as an informer prior to entry into the Witness Protection Program.The film has a dry sense of humor and is technically and visually amazing. Scorsese loves the mobster milieu and is obviously working in his element here with a nicely picked cast. The attention to detail, the camera work, the costumes, the choice of music is all well thought out to the most intimate minutiae. The film is a fairly fascinating peek at life inside the Mafia. Scorsese allows events to unfold believably and the moments near the end where Henry and Karen become increasingly paranoid that they are under surveillance, complete with jittery, over bright intense camera work that heightens their unease, is arguably some of Scorsese's best work.The acting is fairly solid. Liotta manages to hold things together as the focal character and he gets nice support from Bracco. DeNiro manages a dignified turn as Liotta's mentor and friend. Joe Pesci won the Oscar as the psychotic killer Tommy DeVito. He is utilized well enough here to overlook the fact that it is basically the same performance he gives in everything else.Yet as amazing as the film is, it still has its drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the classic that many of its admirers would have you believe. As fascinating as Goodfellas is, I actually find Scorsese's similarly themed subsequent work Casino just as impressive technically, yet far more interesting in that it tells its tale using the backdrop of the formation of gambling mecca Las Vegas. I realize that I am in the minority with that view, but there it is.Yet most notable of all is that Goodfellas seems utterly incapable of connecting on an emotional level with the viewer. The superior Godfather films featured similar themes and focused on characters capable of shocking acts of violence, yet managed to connect on an emotional level so that we had some concern for the players. By contrast, at the end of Goodfellas, as brilliant as I thought some of the direction and technical aspects were, I found that I did not give a damn what happened to any of the characters on screen, including Henry and Karen. I was completely indifferent to whether they lived, died, escaped, etc. And this issue makes for a somewhat empty viewing experience.1990 was a very interesting film year. Coppola released his last Godfather film that year. Although it got an Oscar nod, critics largely overlooked it in favor of Goodfellas due to the fact that it is not on the same level as its predecessors. There is no question Godfather III is a flawed film, but it is also more emotionally rich than Goodfellas and any one of its flaws is more interesting to discuss at length than any of Goodfellas successes. Conversely, critics and Scorsese fans have spilled gallons of ink over the \"injustice\" of Dances With Wolves winning the Best Picture over Goodfellas, but it is not hard to see why it did. DWW in its own right is just as technically impressive as Goodfellas (maybe even more so considering its director was an amateur with a passionate vision), but DWW connects emotionally with the viewer in a far more powerful way than Goodfellas ever does. At the end of DWW and Godfather III, I had to know what happened with those characters. At the end of Goodfellas, not so much. What Scorsese has achieved is certainly noteworthy and makes for a very good, solid gangster film, but most definitely not a masterpiece. It is slick, flashy and technically well done (sometimes even brilliant), but its inability to make me give a damn about any of its characters is a huge stumbling block.",

            "text": "Overrated in 1990, *Goodfellas* has grown even more overrated with the passage of 15 years. It's based on the -- I daresay -- untrustworthy recollections of a half-Irish, half-Sicilian mobster-turned-informant who recently, I am reliably informed, appears as an addled, half-witted guest on \"The Howard Stern Show\". The narrative arc, if one can accurately term it that, spans 30 years, roughly from 1950 to 1980. This, of course, gives Martin Scorsese every incentive to soak the background with dozens of pop-culture tunes ranging from Bobby Vinton to Derek and the Dominoes. His use of the last 3 lilting minutes of \"Layla\" as some sort of ironic counterpoint in the extended montage that reveals the corpses of a dozen gruesomely executed mobsters in various places across New York City only underscores his utterly conventional taste in music. One wonders whether Scorsese would've been happier as a Top 40 deejay instead of a filmmaker.His conventionality -- a surprising development, given his success with such Seventies classics as *Mean Streets* and *Taxi Driver*, both infused with his uniquely individual aesthetic -- extends beyond the soundtrack to the actual movie itself. Lovers of this movie will doubtless be distressed to learn that the various stylistic techniques Scorsese uses here -- whip-pans, sudden freezes that supposedly add ironic punctuation to the narrative, even the use of pop music as commentary on a montage -- all derive from French (yes, I said French) auteurs from the New Wave school of the Sixties and Seventies. These same lovers of this movie would probably also consider Orson Welles to be an overrated old fuddy-duddy, but that doesn't stop Scorsese from pointlessly laying on at least two sequences of long tracking-shots through complicated spatial arrangements without cuts, the device Welles perfected if not wholly invented. (An even less impressive feat for Scorsese, who benefits from the technological advance of the Steadicam. Welles did it with old-fashioned cameras on dollies and hydraulic cranes.) I believe that all these borrowings betray Scorsese's fundamental, perhaps unconscious, lack of confidence in the power of his story, here.For the screenplay, let it be said at once, is poorly constructed. The narrative focuses on trivial events, like a gofer getting shot in the foot during a card game or Paul Sorvino slicing garlic to atomic thinness, and then presents the world-famous Lufthansa heist through hearsay. The movie's main character, Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, hears a news report about the heist while in the shower. One may reasonably ask why we're in the shower with Henry when we should be in the getaway car with Robert De Niro's Jimmy Conway and his henchmen. This, of course, leads one to reasonably ask why we're not watching a movie about Jimmy Conway instead of Henry Hill, the latter being, more often than not, on the periphery of the movie's main events. Having Liotta narrate the exciting stuff for us in voice-over is no substitute. Indeed, the movie is cripplingly dependent on voice-over narration, perhaps because Mr. Hill's own story, in and of itself, isn't interesting enough to really warrant a honest-to-goodness movie in the first place. As the movie drones on with Liotta's loquacious narrator ceaselessly filling in the narrative gaps, one suspiciously wonders -- for example -- why Hill and Conway are NOT whacked for bumping off \"made man\" Billy Bats, while Joe Pesci's Tommy DOES get whacked. All three men were involved in the killing, yet only Tommy pays the price. Why? Does Conway's and Hill's Irishness serve as a magical force-field? -- I don't get it. Well, I did say at the beginning of this review that Hill was an untrustworthy storyteller. From the evidence, it appears that Hill was quite conversant with his mob boss's cooking techniques (hence all the time wasted on cooking scenes and shots of gorgeously laid-out family feasts) and far less conversant with the important incidents that are the subject of this film. Note too how inconsistently handled Henry's character is throughout the film: one moment he pistol-whips almost to death a sexual predator who messes with his girlfriend, the next he's aghast when some punk kid gets carelessly killed. Hmm -- smells like self-hagiography to me.After an overly-edited, chaotic, 30-minute final act in which a sweaty-faced, puffy-eyed Liotta drives around the suburbs, peering up through his windshield at police helicopters, dropping off hot guns, going to the grocery store, zipping back home to make meatballs (AGAIN with the cooking!), and so forth, he gets pinched for good. Under the umbrella of the Witness Protection program, he finally rats out his mob bosses . . . and it occurs to us that this should have been the focus of the film all along, i.e., the FBI's successful eroding of the criminal code using Witness Protection. But Scorsese crams it in during the last five minutes of this 3-hour movie. A little less time in the kitchen and in the shower, and a little more time getting down to business, might have made this movie pretty great.As it is, the performers give *Goodfellas* undeniable energy, almost mitigating all its flaws. Fans of good New York actors will forgive this movie everything: Liotta, De Niro, Pesci, Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco do THEIR job, at least. And perhaps this is why the movie is so well-loved. Colorful characters limned by great performances are entertaining. But, in my judgment, the virtues of verisimilitude can't overcome what amounts to a 3-hour-long non-story.3 stars out of 10.",

The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters.

In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending.",

Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic).

If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.",

            "text": "This is an enjoyable film to watch, and if you're on the tail end of its theater run or considering if it's worth streaming, the short answer is it's worth seeing. I do feel like among certain fan circles the movie is slightly 'overhyped' but that doesn't make the movie bad, it is in fact quite good. I think the exploration of the main character's relationship with kamikaze piloting, and in turn both Japan's historical understanding of that phenomenon as well as the West's, is actually still more poignant and worth exploring than perhaps we might be inclined to give it credit for. It's hard to overstate how culturally significant the kamikaze pilots were during and in the immediate aftermath of World War 2; although we had Oppenheimer to remind us of the cultural impact of the bomb, for soldiers that lived during World War 2, it was the stories of the kamikaze pilots that left a huge impact, even for people not in the Pacific theater. Likewise, Japan has long struggled to articulate its historical relationship to kamikaze pilots, with the memorial there being a kind of hot-button issue for multiple decades now. This film perhaps doesn't offer a searing insight, but rather a kind of wishful alternate path to how Japan and the west feels about kamikaze pilots. I think what's particularly remarkable about this film, frankly, is the way it pushes against the grain--a lot of Japanese cinema, especially that designed for view by western audiences, tends toward a construction of victimhood due to the bomb. This film tries to grapple with the echoes of imperial desire both immediately after the war and, perhaps, now.Honestly, come for the big cool depiction of Godzilla, but leave with a reflection of Japan's relationship to World War 2.",

You won't regret seeing the film, but I didn't walk away feeling like I'd just watched the film of the year either.Godzilla Minus One follows the story of a kamikaze pilot who aborts his mission and lands on a small supply island. Later, Godzilla emerges and wipes out nearly everyone. Haunted by his actions, both in failing to carry out his mission and failing to act in saving the others on the island, the pilot returns to Tokyo and attempts to rebuild his life. Before long though, Godzilla reemerges and he feels compelled to join the defense of Tokyo.It's a good story, and there's an endearing human element to it all. The movie's not short of political commentary either, whether in subtext or unambiguous comments from the characters, ranging from views of honor and duty, criticism of the government, or even Japan's diminished autonomy in light of defeat in WWII. Notice that no government really does anything in the movie. The U. S. is sidelined because of concerns over raising tensions with the Soviets; the Japanese government is unable to act. Instead, it's the people themselves who have to act and save themselves.Towards the end, the film veers harder and harder towards melodrama, which detracted from the nice balance of seriousness and humor that had been present throughout the first several acts. Maybe it's a terrific Godzilla film; I can't speak to that. (This reminds me of the 007 films. There are \"good\" Bond films that still aren't good movies.) I can say that this Godzilla is a good movie and worth your time.",

It would look great in a modern Anime, or something where everything is in CGI, but not this. The only good thing about this movie was the acting, and only if you are used to the acting in older Japanese flicks, where it's a bit over the top and sappy at times, but it felt like everyone was acting in-period together, and really helped set the tone for the movie's classic look and feel.Other than this, everything about it was rubbish. The storyboard and cuts were nonsensical and felt disjointed and abrupt. There was no seamless flow between scenes or parts, which made it feel amateurish like a pilot of a new TV series sometimes is. Don't even get me started on the cartoonish looking Godzilla, with it's undersized head, googly eyes, and baby t-rex like arms. As if the CGI wasn't bad enough, the director decided to make Godzilla look like a joke on purpose as homage to the original, but it just made me unnerved to watch. It's not scary anymore because of this; the fear wasn't there for me because of the poorly executed cgi, lack of build-up to destruction scenes, or enough shots of Godzilla doing anything.I can't believe the same director thinks he's good enough to shoot a Star Wars movie because of the feedback he's getting from this movie. Please don't.Also, save yourself some time and grief and don't go see this movie. I was seriously embarrassed to bring my partner to this after reading all the hype.

My Japanese is not good enough to understand all of the film so there will be lots that I didn't get. However it manages to be a strong, emotional story with a scary and ferocious Godzilla.

Scientists and former military men come together, borrow some military equipment form a plan to defeat Godzilla.It is also a story about cowardice, the crippling shame that comes with it, and how cowardice can actually buy time for one to build one's courage.

We have seen this story many many times. It was very predictable and very slow.

The characters were one of the things I liked. I like that they didn't need to call anyone to defeat Godzilla, that was nice.My main issue was the editing and plot. I feel if it was cut properly it could have been and hour and half movie instead of a two hours dreadful movie. Also the logistics of the movie annoyed me, the war boats moving so fast, them connecting all the boats to the warship boats in seconds, the coincidence of the main character being in the train when Godzilla attacks, the main character casually finding the girl in the middle of a huge chaos? This is very 90s, if a movie has such a rating and such praise it needs to be better. The acting was also extremely dramatic. I constantly watch Japanese shows and movies and it's overdone but this was was insane.Another issue for me was the CG, not the best Godzilla model I've seen, compared to the one in Kong vs Godzilla.Overall I'm annoyed by the overhype, a movie rated this high should be better, it's rated there with parasite, fight club and game of thrones.

In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a \"real\" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra.",

From its compelling story to its impressive screenplay, acting, VFX, direction, and all other departments, this film delivers on every front.What sets this movie apart is its strong human element and the interaction between the characters. Surprisingly, it's these aspects that resonated with me the most, even in a Godzilla movie where one might expect the focus to be primarily on the monsters.In conclusion, \"Godzilla Minus One\" is a must-watch for any fan of the genre. It not only delivers thrilling monster action but also offers a captivating story with well-developed characters and compelling human drama.",

On the one hand, the Japanese in the immediate post-WWII era have their honor, their pride but most of all their country and citizens to protect and fight for. On the other hand, this version of Godzilla is the eighth wonder of the world, an epic beast with untold strength that can destroy anything at will.At the center, is the Japanese protagonist, a young Kamikaze pilot who in the late summer of 1945, finds it in himself not to give his life for a war that is all but over. He returns to his base only to witness his comrades get slaughtered by the unforeseeable and seemingly unstoppable monster that looks like a dinosaur and can withstand almost any man-made firepower. With this chastening memory burning inside him, he resolves to win the part of the war he takes personally and defeat Godzilla. He takes a post-war job with other ex-military men in disabling sea mines. It doesn't take long for Godzilla to re-emerge, this time as a threat to the Japanese home islands. But with the Cold War now underway and the Japanese government not wanting to step on any big toes, the Japanese civilians are on their own in defending themselves. This is where the ex-pilot and his crew rise to the challenge.The film's trump card is a superior depiction of Godzilla as a menacing, overpowering beast but also a spectacle to behold. The monster is enough to carry the film. A thrilling climax puts the film over the finish line. It's proof that uplifting sci-fi disaster films can still deliver. It's old-time filmmaking but done quite well and therefore enthusiastically recommended to fans of this genre.",

Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title \"Minus One\" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's \"Subarashiki nichiyobi\" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance.",

However, I was still questioning potential plot holes in the story and the films demographic.During the 3rd act, it really tied itself together and started to make a lot more sense. I want to rewatch it knowing how well it ends, similar to a Christopher Nolan film. I'm curious what a child would think of this film because it deals with some adult themes and subject matter that only an adult would relate to. It isn't crude, it's very family friendly. A child might find it slow and boring at times. The moral of the film might go over a child's head but there's plenty of humour and subject matter aimed at children.Overall, I was very impressed with this film, and I'll be watching it again. Take your kids to it. If they don't enjoy it now, it'll definitely have a completely different meaning to them in 10, 20, or 30 years. As an adult, you'll almost definitely enjoy it.",

Cailey (the girl) being from the walking dead too seems to be doing well for herself being put in a Krasinski and Reynolds movie. Sometimes the film lacks and the story gets weak in the middle but overall you can understand it. The ending is probably the best part as it has the most weight to it and emotion about what imaginary friends are and what they do and mean for us.

It has grand ambitions by merging a Spielberg homage about never truly growing up with an attempt to be a live action Pixar movie so even if John Krasinski falls short of these noble goals, he still ends up in a pretty good place.With Ryan Reynolds doing a nice family version of his usual cynical quip machine and a bunch of A-list stars in small voice roles who are fun to recognise if nothing else, it's up to Cailey Fleming to bring all the emotions and really sell the sense of wonder which she achieves with ease. Also, John Krasinski casting himself as the dad avoids vanity thanks to how endearing he is.Crafting a world of imagination isn't easy to do and John Krasinski's direction manages to come up with enough inventive moments to avoid feeling creatively inert. Michael Giacchino's score threatens to be overbearing without completely going there. There's barely a moment where it isn't present and it's got the sense of childlike wonder and adorably twee nature to pull it off.",

But it seemed the key function of pairing imaginary friends with kids to be a very child friendly line. The way it takes it in reality is far more adult while still being a little confusing. I got about 70 minutes into this film and started wondering why, if anything other than a 1 sentence summary John Krasinski and Ryan Reynolds had said this was a live action Pixar film.The ending and the subsequent hours of reinterpretation and pondering leave me in awe of its execution. I still think there are problems, and scenes that feel very haphazard in some ways, and I still feel some bewilderment over a film that takes 90% of its run time to come into its own. It's a fantastic twist, and similar to Gone Girl (an odd but apt and well considered comparison given that to mention any others would constitute a spoiler) is one of the best examples of a twist impacting your entire viewing experience, I've ever seen.

He had almost zero impact on the film, in fact he really didn't even have that many lines at all.The writing in this film also isn't the best, there are times where ithe plot just sort of wanders.There's a scene about 1/2 into this movie that I think showcases what I'm talking about.

Then it found a kids movie footing and I thought it might end strong. It almost stuck the landing, but then it just wanted to dive back into after school special territory.I didn't hate it. It just isn't really the kind of movie that it's billed as.",

A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place: Part 2 were both fantastic horror/thrillers and coming from TV comedies and low-budget indie films, Krasinksi has proven he is more than just the quirky actor we all love. IF is his latest directorial effort and while I'm a fan of family movies and creative ideas, I don't believe this concept was brought to its fullest potential. Sometimes a nice idea just isn't enough, and IF is a perfect showcase of that. With a lot of solid ideas and plot devices going for it, let's dive into what I thought went wrong.After the loss of her mother, Bea (Cailey Fleming) is going through a difficult time in her life. Her father (John Krasinski) is also in the process of having surgery, so the weight on her shoulders when the film begins is quite heavy. Beginning to see a bunch of random, unique-looking creatures and ideas come to life around her, she begins to realize she is seeing the imaginary friends that everyone has grown up with and forgotten. In comes Cal (Ryan Reynolds), who can also see these \"IFs,\" as they embark on a journey together in order to reconnect these \"IFs\" with their people who have grown up. This concept is beautiful and almost even brought a tear to my eye, but I feel as though there are far too many similarities to other films, without it really doing too much to stand out on its own.I will say that the payoff/twist at the end is effective, but maybe it's just that I've seen too many movies like this. I was able to predict the main twist pretty early on in the movie and since that was what it all built up to, I felt a little underwhelmed. Still, for those who don't see a few things coming, I'm sure you will feel the emotion more than me. It's a well-constructed movie overall and Krasinski still continues to prove he has a knack for directing, it's just that the magic he thought he was heavily injecting into the film felt a little flat to me. I will also say that there are many times when some viewers may find it overly sappy, but I found those moments to be a nice cherry on top of an otherwise good, but predictable movie.In the end, this is something kids may enjoy, but I feel it's also aiming for adults with mature storylines. However, these two things clashed for me on multiple occasions because I wasn't sure if it was trying to be cute or thought-provoking. Maybe the answer to that is both, but it didn't work for me. The overall story is more than worth the time, so I'll give it a mild recommendation, but maybe temper your expectations, especially if you've been looking forward to this one. IF is a great story in a mediocre execution of a movie. It's now playing in theatres, but you can wait for this one.",

            "text": "The archetypal action film, Seven Samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid. Each of its characters is extraordinarily realized; each has his or her own arc, his or her own vital part to play in the film's slow progression towards its dramatic finale. Typically, Kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry; each and every shot, each action sequence, is exquisitely composed; and yet none seems contrived or out-of-place within the overall fabric of the work. Everything is beautifully conceived and in focus, both literally and figuratively.When watching Seven Samurai, movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last half-century. The audition scenes, in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits, strikes a particularly familiar chord, as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons. Indeed, the theme of a highly experienced group of \"tough guys\" taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche, portions of which echo throughout the American western, as well as its progeny (think The Dirty Dozen, The Road Warrior or even television's The A Team).But what really stands out in Seven Samurai are its characters. They run the gamut, from elder teacher to hopeful youth, stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand. Kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance, not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town. Perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless-- there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists, the villains need not be more than a vague threat. Through it all Kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another. Obviously, the samurai are, for the most part, samurai, while the townspeople are merely peasants, lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders. Kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter, who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai; and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all, but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors. The film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity. The samurai unite to defend the poor peasants, but the ending is not exactly happy for them. Nor are the peasants completely honorable. We learn, for instance, that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies, and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparent.So why do the samurai defend them so valiantly? For honor? For love of adventure? The answer to this question is left intentionally vague; it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions. It is to the film's credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untrue.Modern viewers will find the action sequences of Seven Samurai to be restrained. There are, for instance, no \"Gladiator\" or \"Braveheart\" moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off, blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio. But the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments. The 3 1/2 hour running time may also deter some, but I find the length to be one of the film's charms; it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches, and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward. Don't miss it.10/10",

            "text": "I discovered 16 of Kurosawa's best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It's basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you've ever seen. The premise: in chaotic 16th century Japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. Yet Kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. To its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, Seven Samurai never falters or bores. And if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. It is said that Kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. This unusual technique gave Seven Samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history.The samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles. The story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).In the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite.",

            "text": "Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (\"Seven Deadly Sins\") number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage's silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney's first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen's ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman's literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (\"The Seventh Seal\") (1957), Billy Wilder's Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher's disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90's, as well as Tsui Hark's Chat Gim (\"Seven Swords\") (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.However, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, Shichinin no samurai (\"Seven Samurai\") (1954) from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This movie doesn't seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for.It is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. Nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of Japan.Characterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai's true leader, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. In joining the village protection campaign, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in its noble cause.Together with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative.Though triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. In the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. That is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don't even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. Peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books.Seven Samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the Edo period, marking the governance of Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for Japan's long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by IMDb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events.Originating in the Edo-era Far East, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (Y. Brynner, S. McQueen, C. Bronson, J. Coburn, E. Wallach, R. Vaughn, H. Buchholz, B. Dexter) Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), conveniently situated in the U. S. West of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, Return of... (1966), Guns of... (1969), and ...Ride! (1972).",

I don't see how anyone, especially a non-Japanese, could possibly absorb this movie in less than 2 or 3 viewings. I've always been surprised at how each of the 7 samurai can make such an individual impression on you even if you can't understand Japanese. Although Toshiro Mifune is often considered the star, for me its Takashi Shimura who is firmly fixed at the center of the movie.  He is the guiding moral force from the moment of his appearance in the film and can capture the viewer's attention in a way similar to Alec Guinness.  Mifune's character can be annoying at first in his loutish behavior, but he gains stature throughout the film and eventually becomes a unifying force second only to Shimura.  Minoru Chiaki as the woodcutting samurai provides a subtle humor and the others look to him to boost their morale.  Daisuke Kato is another very familiar face to Japanese movie fans and provides an excellent foil to Shimura as his second in command.  Yoshio Inaba is very good as the samurai who is recruited by Shimura and quickly builds a strong rapport with him.  Seiji Miyaguchi as the \"expert\" warrior, dedicated to honing his skill as a swordsman is a very low key yet likeable character.  Ko Kimura as the young hero-worshipping samurai, as well as the love interest of the peasant girl, wishes to be a great samurai, but is easily distracted by a field of flowers or a pretty face.  The peasants in the village being defended by the samurai each have their own defining characteristics as well.In addition to the wealth of interesting characters, we have a terrific action plot--the defending of the village from 40 marauding bandits by the small troop of samurai--, and a more subtle secondary plot involving the distrust of the samurai by the villagers due to the historical interaction of these two classes in feudal Japan.  All of these plot and character elements are woven together into an unforgettable epic, but, at least in my opinion, its not one that can be absorbed in a single sitting.  While it's similar in this sense to another of my favorite epics, Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, it is more complex given the number of characters.I can only say that your patience with this film will probably be well rewarded if you take the time to give it multiple viewings.  You will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors.  If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts.  This one is 10 out of 10 without a doubt.",

It was an epic that truly told the whole story. Whereas most movies today manage to skirt around huge chunks of what would happen, this movie manages to show them all, and not in a boring way. The samurai don't even reach the village in danger until more than 30 minutes into the film, all that time being spent getting to know each of the characters and the motivation and history behind them. We get to truly learn what it takes to be a samurai, and what truly sets them apart. By the time we arrive at the village we have become attached to some of the samurai in a very personal way, respecting each of them in their own way. The rest of the movie progresses as if it were a documentary, not a fictional film, where we see each and every piece of the grand puzzle that happens in this village. I can't recommend this film enough, though I must throw a disclaimer out that if you're not a fan of epic movies with subtitles you may not be as interested. It is a 3 1/2 hour long movie!

            "text": "Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making (in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular), and out of the few Kurosawa movies I've had the pleasure of viewing (Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, and this) I'd have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite, I nevertheless had a blast during this one. The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand. Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn't his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn't over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn't a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic.",

The earlier films were dark, bleak and unsettling viewing and therefore going into Seven Samurai I was of two minds. First I expected more of the same, in both quality and tone but then on the flipside at time of writing this is ranked as the 19th highest rated movie on IMDB which is incredible.My expectations were that it would be good, but that's about it. Seeing Takashi Shimura in the credits also confirmed my logic that this was going to at least be an entertaining three and a half hours.I was mistaken, Seven Samurai is not good............it's outstanding.Wonderfully crafted, perfectly scored, incredibly choreographed, well acted and beautifully written this is well deserving of it's high place and I would consider it nothing short of a masterpiece.If you check out my IMDB rating distribution it's very clear to see that getting anything higher than an eight is a rarity, this deserves it on so many levels.I didn't expect this level of quality further as generally I don't tend to agree with titles in the IMDB top 250, this however I do I thoroughly unconditionally agree.A masterpiece and essential viewing, I don't even need to give the premise of the movie in this review and must simply stress that this is film making mastery at its finest.The Good:Takashi ShimuraVery well shot for its timePerfectly craftedThe Bad:Nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:Akira Kurosawas should be a household name, not Bruckheimer or Bay!I'll put money down now that none of the remakes or movies heavily influenced by Seven Samurai comes close in quality",

It was indeed masterful storytelling with great character development, but the movie seemed to take quite a long time to get going, and when it did it was not the cinematic juggernaut I was expecting. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't think so. As of this writing Seven Samurai is at #6 in the all-time greatest movies list (and the only foreign-born film in the top 20), so I've obviously missed something big.This was by no means a bad movie; it was in fact a very good movie. However, all the really excellent movies I've seen have one thing in common - they carry you away with them. You get so involved with the story and characters that you feel like you know them personally. I did not get that here. Instead I kept trying to figure out what was going on, and why people were dramatically wailing and rolling on the ground in reaction to situations that didn't seem to warrant it. Is there perhaps a cultural difference that I'm not linking into? Am I over-analyzing it? I fully expected to walk away from this film wide-eyed and and muttering 'Wow. Just.wow' over and over (as I have with so many other films on IMDb's top 100), but instead I'm left to ponder why I seem to be the only one who's not getting it.

            "text": "Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really  qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most  influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well  nearly 50 years later.  Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in  so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show  its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters,  mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that  wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after  so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a  totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.  Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been  born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred  Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it  look easy... who so obviously \"get it\". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is  perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his  finest moments.  The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an  epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of  inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits  and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few  directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such  attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must  go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume   The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the  most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean  period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of  characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are  seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really  shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.  Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is  the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the  common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the  farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and  treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a  mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities  that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave,  righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands  in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest  that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting  to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to  respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless  I'm mis-reading him wildly.  I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white  movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the  21st century? The answer is a definite \"Yes!\". Seven Samurai shows us  what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture  as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly  claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and  still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should  use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever  be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope  or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad  thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the  Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and  marketing is the new god",

            "text": "You know, even though I consider myself a rather big film nerd, I can't say that I've seen much when it comes to Japanese cinema. I mean, I've seen my fair share of anime, sure, but when it comes to non-animated stuff I could count the number of Japanese movies I've seen on one hand. Even so, I know who Akira Kurosowa is. If Hayao Miyazaki is the best known Japanese animation director, then Kurosowa is the best known director of Japanese live-action films. I've only watched one other film from him so far, High and Low, and it was pretty good, but, in my opinion, RIDICOULOUSLY overrated among film nerds. Considering the fact that Seven Samurai is even more highly regarded, and my previous experience with Kurosowa, I didn't really know what to feel or what to expect. Before watching this movie, though, a fellow film-nerd told me that Kurosowa is like a Japanese Spielberg. After watching this movie, I can say that this is pretty accurate, in the context of this film, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's dive into it.Seven Samurai is a 1954 Japanese film, and it follows a little village of farmers in 16th century Japan. Each year, after harvest, bandits come to the village and forcefully take most of the crop. The farmers, in a desperate measure, decide to send a few people to look for Samurai that could protect the village. The problem is that Samurai are from the highest levels of society, while the farmers are poor and can only pay with food. As the film progresses and the mission to prepare the village to defeat the bandits once and for all proceeds, we see the internal conflicts, the seemingly impossible fight that's in front of the farmers and the bloody chaos that rules in 16th century, war-infested Japan.The Spielberg comparison actually makes so much sense to me after watching this movie. Critics and film nerds alike tend to worship Spielberg, but at the end of the day he is, generally, a blockbuster director. Very accessible, very mainstream, able to dabble in different genres each time but still be adored by almost everyone with each film he releases. From my experience with Spielberg so far he tends to capture ideas that weren't really brought to the mainstream before and execute them in ways that are maybe not mind-blowing, but are definitely enough to make an impact on the mainstream - sometimes the result is pretty good, sometimes it's just okay. This is, more or less, how I feel about Seven Samurai. This movie is like the prototype, or the gen-1, or even the original, if you will, blockbuster.We'll come back to that later, but I want to touch on some other aspects of the film. First of all, it's truly well-made visually. Kurosowa is known for his masterful blocking, and though I can't say that there are many shots that made me feel something, many of them are really pleasant and well-composed. Gotta give credit when it's due. This just goes to show you that whether a film looks good is not a question of technology first, but more a question of how good is the directing, the cinematography, the composition of each scene.I really like the score, too. From the brooding, dark theme song, through the colorful music of the big city and to the careful, almost childish music in the background of the romance-related scenes. It's not crazy, but again, well-made. An aspect of this film I definitely enjoyed.I think that when talking about this film as a blockbuster, one can really appreciate the scope of this movie, considering the time in which it came out. At almost 3.5 hours, and with a really big cast of characters and grand battle scenes, this film was really ambitious. It almost made the studio go broke with how much money the production needed. Nothing can take that away from this movie, but even though it's very impressive to pull this sort of plot off in the 1950's, it doesn't make this film good. You see, there are some parts of the story that I like - cool use of tropes that later became classic, some aspects of the romance subplot, the BURNING HOUSE SCENE WITH THE GIRL WAKING UP (which is WAY too good for this movie, honestly), the way that this movie manages to make us feel the setting, the location, how it teaches us about the village's structure to make one of the more realistic battle scenes I've seen, strategically speaking. But these parts are not the main thing here, and are scattered throughout the movie. Most of it I honestly find nothing more than okay, and sometimes (like almost every scene with Kikuchiyo) it's just too stiff, too forced, too shallow. A film that establishes so many characters (that are simple but still all different) might really need this runtime, sure, it's not unheard of, but the story itself is just not that interesting. I like some parts of it, but 3.5 hours that are mostly just pretty decent to mediocre blockbuster material are just not worth it. Sorry for anyone who loves this film, but this is how I feel.Seven Samurai's scope is definitely impressive, and it has some cool, fun moments, well-composed shots and a good soundtrack. The biggest chunk of this 3.5-hour long movie, though, is somewhere between mediocre and not bad, and this just won't do in such a long film. It becomes tiresome, and along with the parts of this film that feel too over-the-top to really work, I feel like this movie is not much more than a mediocre experience. Again - it has some good, and not a lot of bad, but with such a length and not enough substance it just doesn't succeed at getting me immersed. Feeling a 5.8/10 on this one.",

The story and characters are developed carefully, and everything about the movie, from the settings and props to the musical score, is done carefully and expertly.Mifune grabs the attention in most of his scenes, and Shimura's more restrained character is a nice balance.  Those two have the best parts, but all seven of the samurai are memorable characters.  The sequence of events that collects the seven together occupies the first part of the movie, and forms a perfect foundation for the rest.  A few of the villagers are also portrayed nicely, although they are naturally overshadowed when the samurai are around.The story always moves along nicely, with many ups and downs.  It has enough unpredictability to keep you interested the whole time, without ever losing its credibility.  There is plenty of action, but there is also substance behind the action to give it more significance.  The only possible drawback is the long running time (you can always split it up into two installments, but it's more satisfying if you can watch the whole story through at once), but there is little that you could cut out, even if you wanted to.  It holds your attention the entire time with a good story and great technique, not by resorting to sensational or sordid details.This movie well deserves its reputation for excellence, and is one that everyone who appreciates classic cinema will want to see and enjoy.",

            "text": "To truly appreciate how the motion picture became the art form of the twentieth century, you have to watch one that's not in the English language. By immersing yourself into a cinematic offering form France or Italy, Germany or Russia, Iran or India, only then will you profoundly understand the universality of film. Japan produced a titan whose success lifted his country's film industry from the ashes of defeat in the Second World War, and thus, placed it on a pedestal to compete with on an international level. That titan's name was Akira Kurosawa.Kurosawa was one of the most influential directors in movie history, looked up to with reverence by his fellow filmmakers. Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kubrick, Satyajit Ray, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Federico Fellini, and Werner Herzog are among those who have enthusiastically sung his praises. Even Kurosawa's idols, such as John Ford, expressed admiration for his skills. Kurosawa opened the world's eyes up to Japanese cinema when RASHOMON took the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1951. Curiously, his countrymen peers weren't ecstatic over his triumph, accusing him of selling out Japanese filmmaking by adopting Western ideals and forsaking Eastern traditions. But Kurosawa smashed through where many had failed.The film generally regarded as his best is SEVEN SAMURAI, one of the most rousing motion pictures in history. Look on any website {Rotten Tomatoes, Sight & Sound, etc} that display their choices for best-of-all-time, and chances are you'll find SEVEN SAMURAI placed somewhere in the top ten. It spawned John Sturges' Western remake THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, which in turn inspired sequels, a television series, and another remake in 2016 starring Denzel Washington. In addition, SAMURAI's theme of a group of disparate men uniting for a noble cause launched a plethora of commando action flicks in its wake, ie. THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, DIRTY DOZEN, etc.Kurosawa had already established his reputation prior to SEVEN SAMURAI, but by no means was Toho Studios prepared to indulge him with a blank cheque. During the preproduction stage, it was clear that what he and his writers were putting together was going to be the most epic movie ever made in Japan. Because of SAMURAI's scope, Kurosawa eschewed shooting on the Toho lot in favor of building a set in the countryside because he felt the location's authenticity would have a positive effect on his actors' performances. To the chagrin of Toho executives, he also set up multiple cameras for certain action scenes so that it would look more fluidly on screen. In doing so, he ensured that takes and retakes were kept to a minimum....and therefore allow him to cut the film without the possibility of any continuity errors.A shortage of horses for the climactic action caused production to be temporarily shut down, not the first time it happened during filming. At least twice the Toho powers-that-be pulled the plug due to cost overruns, leading Kurosawa to pass the time by fishing his stress away, correctly surmising that Toho would never shelve SEVEN SAMURAI after investing so much time and money in it. But the delays resulted in the movie being completed in the cold winter, an ordeal leading actor Toshiro Mifune later recalled as his most physically demanding. But it sure looked exciting on celluloid!!!The percussive tempo on SEVEN SAMURAI's opening credits do a better job of establishing the epic drama to transpire than any studio orchestra could ever hope to accomplish. The story is set in 1580's Japan, an era of feudalism, high taxes, drought, and forced labor. Every year a small peaceful rural settlement is subjected to annual plundering by bandits, leaving the farmers with precious little crops remaining to feed their families. Feeling that God has abandoned them, the helpless villagers consult with the town elder for counsel. The old man recalls how one hamlet was spared from pillaging, and that was only because they hired samurai for protection. Because there is nothing but rice to offer as payment, the advice he dispenses to his humble flock is simple: find hungry samurai!!Four of the peasants embark on a scouting mission from one village to another in the hope of successfully recruiting experienced fighters. Their search for a strong leader ends when they observe Kambei, a middle-aged ronin {or masterless samurai}, subdue an outlaw who'd taken a young child hostage. Exhausted by a lifetime of battles, Kambei carries about him an aura of weary honor which precludes him being classified as a mercenary. Approached by the timid strangers, Kambei accepts their proposal as a matter of principle, and begins hashing out some preliminary details. The first decision is the most obvious: given the number of adversaries they will face, at least six more samurai are going to be needed.And now for the vetting process!! Kambei doesn't have to look too far for his first recruit; Katsushiro derives from warrior bloodlines but has never been tested in combat. Like the farmers, he watched in awe as Kambei disarmed of the outlaw, and has wanted to be his Bff ever since. Another applicant is Gorobei, an affable archer whose talents earn him the position of second-in-command. A one-time lieutenant of Kambei's, Shichiroji,\npasses by and gladly enlists in their cause. That brings the number up to four!!The most lethal enlistee is Kyuzo, a quiet, unassuming swordsman who prefers to let his weapon do his talking for him. Kyuzo doesn't see much point in wasting oxygen on small talk because he feels his lung power should best be reserved for battle. The next recruit is Heihachi, a skilled woodsman and carpenter. He doesn't possess the swordplay of his new comrades, but his talent for boosting morale will make him indispensable during critical situations. That's six!!!The most unpredictable one is ronin wannabe Kikuchiyo (played with gusto by Toshiro Mifune), an untamed peasant looking to find his place in the world. He presents Kambei with a scroll that's the sixteenth century equivalent of a birth certificate. But the dates recorded would indicate his present age to be thirteen....which he cleat is not!! It's later revealed that Kikuchiyo descended from farming lineage, something he regards as a badge of shame, which is why he is so determined to be the seventh samurai. Aware that there's no way to discourage him, Kambei relents.Kambei and Gorobei realize that the farmers can't always expect knights in armor to come to their aid, that they will have to be able to arm and defend themselves. Not possessing Kyuzo's blade skills nor Gorobei's archery prowess, the raw Kikuchiyo proves himself useful by subjecting the peasants to basic training, despite his own background being sketchy at best. While Kikuchiyo is channeling his inner Marine drill sergeant the others map out strategy and create spears from bamboo sticks. A creek runs through the village, separating four huts from the larger remainder. Therefore, Kambei orders those huts to be abandoned so that everyone can be concentrated on the more populous side and not be divided.With the time afforded them until the bandits arrive, the magnificent seven wisely utilize it by furthering the village's fortifications. Samurai and farmers alike work together on building a protective moat and erecting large wooden fences to strengthen the the geographical weaknesses. Only one pathway is deliberately left unprotected....to lure their adversaries into a trap. Furthermore, to ensure a successful ambush, the samurai will also have to keep an eye open for enemy scouts!!Despite SEVEN SAMURAI's running time clock in at three and a half hours, Kurosawa nevertheless fluidly balances the film's visual scope with its intimate moments, a hallmark of intuitive filmmaking. Across the Pacific and beyond, CinemaScope and 3-D were taking the movies by storm in order to compete with television. SEVEN SAMURAI had already begun production in the soon-to-be antiquated standard aspect ratio when Hollywood debuted the wide-screen process in 1953, and were not willing to switch formats in midstream. But in the hands of Kurosawa, SEVEN SAMURAI is a cinematic depth charge that blows all other Fifties epics right out of the water, with THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI being perhaps the only exception.As much as the action in SEVEN SAMURAI's second half is well worth waiting for, the characterizations never take a back seat. Kurosawa weaves the subplots into the main storyline so skillfully that nothing looks derivative or tacked on. His most impressive pictorial touch is what is now known as \"the wipe\", the visual effect where a thin vertical line appears onscreen moving from right to left when one scene is ending and another is about to begin. Kurosawa thought it would be more effective than the slow dissolve. Although he wasn't the first to use that technique, he made it so influential it was subsequently borrowed by baby boomer directors such as George Lucas, who utilized it in his Star Wars series.The legacy of SEVEN SAMURAI has endured ever since its making seventy years ago. Lucas admitted that Kurosawa influenced more than just The Wipe; sharp-eyed analysts have noticed how much the Jedi knights have in common with the feudal era ronin. Light sabers are simply the intergalactic substitute for the Japanese katana. And let's not forget the correlation between samurai movies and American Westerns, especially those made by Ford. Kurosawa applied many innovative touches, but there can be no disputing how he adopted one of Ford's deceptively simplistic methods of directing a picture, which was \"photograph the actor's eyes\" because, after all, aren't the eyes supposed to be the windows to the soul? Sometimes the great art of a film lays with its apparent artlessness.🔚",

            "text": "It is hard to know exactly where to begin when talking about a film of such utter quality.  What must be said at the start is that \"The Seven Samurai\" is flawless.  It's characters are brought to life by some of the finest and most committed acting I have ever seen. It is a compelling story of courage, duty, honor, respect and change.I could echo Roger Ebert's commentary, in which he noted that Kurosawa's film set the standard for the modern action film. It was he notes the first film to assemble a team of hardened men to undertake a mission.  But I say read Eberts review if you want to get his take.I have watched the film several times and what is truly amazing about \"The Seven Samurai\" is the way in which Kurosawa choses to tell his tale, which is, I think, truly innovative and subtle.Growing up on action fare as we have \"Seven Samurai\" should really hold no magic for us.  We have the formula (in many forms) before.  Countless times. However it is not old to us and magic it carries. I make the case (now anyway) that this comes largely from Kurosawa's knack,  his amazing gift, for photographic composition.  Most filmmakers today in the action genre have some flare for flashy cinematography.  We get sharp angles, dramatic poses (most favorably lighted), and fast cuts.  I guess this is to involve us in the high emotion of the situation.  But Kurosawa has patience and while I think he gave the blocking of his shots, and their composition a great deal of thought, it comes across as if he did not.  His camera moves as though it were simply following the characters through the story.  The camera work in \"Seven\" is so much more subtle and so much more compelling than almost any action fare today.  His camera allows, we the viewer, to be, at various times, all of the major characters in the film.Toshiro Mifune's emotional explosion at his \"fellow\" Samurai is probably the most obvious example of this.  He gets up and at first appears to agree with the Samurai sentiment that killing all of the villagers is a good idea, but when he turns and his anger is directed at them the scene and our place in it change.  We are no longer passive viewers watching heated exchange between two factions.  The angry Toshiro is yelling at us, looking down at us.  For we are looking up at him as his fellow samurai would see him. By the end of his out burst he angrily leaves the room but before he goes he turns slightly to look at us, but we don't see his face, for now we are looking (in one of the great shots of the film) at his feet.  The Samurai are ashamed and so are we because we identified with them at first and Kurosawa had the guts to show us that we are wrong to do so.I could go on, and on about his film, but I leave you with this, watch  it.",

            "text": "This movie is considered one of the greatest movies of all time and was certainly groundbreaking in many ways. However, for this viewer, there were too many flaws or distractions to allow me to rate it higher than a 7.Yes, the story is well told, but the movie is too long. Some scenes drag on longer than necessary to make the point. There is a lot of setup to get to the more entertaining action scenes in the last third of the movie.Some things that particularly bothered me and detracted from the movie for me were the incredibly obvious skull caps that many of the main characters wore. It was close to comical with some actors and that immediately distracted me and weakened the movie for me. Next, while Kirasawa is famous for his attention to detail and cinematography in the battle scenes, there were real weaknesses there. While the villagers had very long spears, they did not seem to use them to maximum effect, when simply ramming the riders with the spears would have been enough in real life to knock them off their horses immediately or kill them outright. They also would have used them against the horses themselves in a real battle. Then, in most cases after riders fell from their horses, even when surrounded they almost always were able to crawl away briefly before being stabbed. Next, despite the great potential for exciting sword fights between the samurais and the bandits, this was almost or entirely nonexistant. The samurais never really got to show their skill, other than single swipes at the riders or simply stabbing the bandits. A complete waste of cinematic excitement!Finally, while presumably the bandits were in it to fight to the death, this is only hinted at and it just seemed idiotic for their forces to get weaker and weaker and yet they continue to attack with no hope for success or even a plan to win. I could not help but focus on how stupid they were and that it was obvious they were going to lose badly. The film tries to build up the drama for the \"climactic\" battle, but it is completely ridiculous.Last, while the bandits have their \"fort\" destroyed by fire, they never think to use fire to defeat the villagers. This, again, makes no sense at all and was so obvious a solution that it was very distracting.Another annoying factor was that the villagers were portrayed as completely pathetic, actually crying hysterically many times in the movie. They came across more as losers than people deserving of sympathy. I just didn't get the purpose of the excessive crying. Also, a few times the screaming of various characters seemed excessive and made them less realistic to me.So, in conclusion, these were significant flaws to me that brought my rating of the film down. I consider it worth watching and overall entertaining, but just not a great film.",

I was also surprised by just how much the \"Magnificent Seven\" was based on this film. Worth watching, especially for foreign film buffs as it's subtitled, but can be a bit of a chore to get through as I had trouble connecting with the characters.

Though extremely long at about 3 1/2 hours it is well worth the time spent.To quickly summarize, a poor Japanese village hires 7 Samurai to protect it from being raided by bandits.  Don't get me wrong there is way more to it than that, I just dont want to give anything away.  This is an intense and emotional movie that hooks you from the first scene and keeps you on the line till it is all over.  The battle scene at the end is in true Kurosawa form.  The acting is outstanding by everyone involved from the main characters all the way down to the very last extra.  Of course the best way to see any film, especially a Kurosawa film is on the big screen if you are able to.  Beautifully filmed, in black and white, anyone familiar with Kurosawa's work has to wonder visually how much more gorgeous it could have been had Kurosawa had the option of color in 1954.The camera use is brilliant and every scene is balanced visually.  This film is also the first one to use \"the wipe\" as a way of changing from one scene to another.  This technique was later used by George Lucas in his Star Wars movies.  I would also recommend the DVD version that has the commentary option by the Japanese cinema expert if anyone is interested in a deeper understanding of the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of Kurosawa's film making.  Any man, woman, boy or girl who just wants to see a really, really great movie, THIS IS THE ONE!  An A+++ in my book.",

At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it's first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up \"How do you define 'real'\" Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that 'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.And that's about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid's first viewing, this movie successfully found it's way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it's head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it's writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that's just the power of this film.",

            "text": "The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre.  There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.)  There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects.  With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync.  Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition.  Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes.  The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky.  The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of.  The photography was breathtaking.  (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.)  And the acting?  Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did.  But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting.  As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked!  Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne.  His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation.  My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE.  What is the Matrix, you ask?  Something that's closer to reality than you think.Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.",

            "text": "** May contain spoilers **There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a \"liberator\" or even a \"messiah\" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

            "text": "Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning \"man\" and combine this with the second part of his last name \"son\" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination \"son of man\" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): \"You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.\" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.10/10 - on my top 3 of best films.",

            "text": "Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.",

But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",

            "text": "I see that on this site only the positive reviews for this film are promoted to be on the first pages, which is at least one-sided if not preferential. This makes me think I won't even get read by other users yet alone supported by them (since they all find this movie awesome)... but whatever let me tell you what I think about this movie:The Story: Is probably the most important part of this movie and simultaneously the one which this movie gets so awfully wrong.1. The concept of machines imprisoning humans was exploited so many times by so many TV Shows (Stargate SG-1 for example had a similar concept driven episode) and movies (Dark City), so I expected this movie to go deep into why would machines imprison humans and have authenticity in its core. I got 0 of that, in fact what did I got? Some stupid explanation saying the machines imprisoned humans because humans loose energy as heat through their skin. OK, it might seem plausible at first sight, but if you know a little about human or about chemistry you will find this concept ridiculous and impossible. Humans lose through heat about 30% of the energy they consume. So that would mean the machines would have to supply the humans with so much energy and then consume the 30% they lose through heat (basically 100% energy used to keep humans alive to 30% energy remained for machines. That means the machines would lose about 70% of the energy they have or invest into sustaining humans alive) why? Because the script says so. If they have that much energy to sustain humans and their necessities for so long why not kill the humans and stick to maybe consume lightning energy which this movie shows to be very satisfying.2. The explanations Morpheus gives Neo are so thin, maybe thinner than a balloon inflated to its maximum. The Matrix was weaker at the beginning so that they escaped? Why hasn't anyone else escaped? How was the Matrix weaker? Does this movie or the next one in the trilogy explain this? No... But yeah because there's a bad-ass character saying these we all should believe this and then say that this movie is a benchmark for all sci-fi to come? I cannot believe that I'm living on this planet where people are fooled so easily by ridiculous explanations that are so thin and they think that they are smart by watching these kind of movies. Oh, but there's more... when other directors come up with a movie thought over 15 years (Inception) and so authentic and realistically executed that starts from correct premises and then exaggerates like any other movie, people make reviews like: \"Overrated because it makes people \"feel\" smart...\". It's incredible that a director that has been making movies since 7 years old and thinks so much about its movies is repaid with bad reviews from people who clearly didn't understood the movie and don't care about dreams, while this movie gets so much praise for having an incorrect premise that just becomes worse as the movie progresses.3. There's no plot twist that can make you say: Yes this movie was thought from start to finish. This movie is just a bunch of action scenes mixed with some poorly explained concepts that have an incorrect scientifically premise and has just enough of all of them to fool the average audiences.The Action: The only part in which this movie succeeded was the action which indeed revolutionized the action flicks back then. Along with the CGI this makes the movie watchable at best (for me at least). But here there are some unexplained things like why if you kiss a person connected to the matrix that person revives and more... becomes even more powerful. It's like a children's movie where the handsome prince kisses the princes or vice versa and she/he wakes up and then they live happily ever after. I expected much more from a movie praised by so many people, but I got 0 explanation for how Neo revives from Trinity's kiss.The Characters: Bland and boring... and so cold especially Morpheus, who was made like this maybe to make him appear more bad-ass. Neo's character is childish for a movie of this magnitude. The chemistry between him and Trinty is not convincing for me. I mean, for the duration of the whole movie she's just kicking ass like Neo, and then they suddenly are lovers... but their relationship has no development because the script is so poor in substance and creates no circumstance in which these characters might interact with each other beside kicking ass and saying one-liners.The Soundtrack: (gotta hurry, word limit) The most bland soundtrack I've heard in my life. For how this movie is promoted as being one of the best ever... I expected a soundtrack that could match this reputation. Actually if you search Don Davis, this composer is known only for Matrix and maybe Jurassic Park III but aside from that, he was never nominated for golden globe, bafta or Oscar (not to say that those matter but other great composers were nominated at least 10 times to Oscars or baftas). There was not a single iconic track in this movie and the score as a whole is just forgettable and underwhelmed.Hope I could include everything I wanted to say in this review. I probably won't get any support for this review, because every person on this planet adores this movie and IMDb supports only good reviews for this movie. And as to why I rate this movie with 5 is because of the CGI and action scenes, because the rest: premise, story, substance or authenticity of the script are either missing or are so thin as a inflated balloon (oh, wait the rating of this movie is as inflated as a inflated balloon... inflated by average people who like only mindless or pseudo-intelligent action).",

The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.",

            "rating": 9.9,
            "text": "My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies. The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called \"the Matrix\", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer \"Neo\" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the \"dream world\".Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen. The slow-motion \"bullet-time\" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, \"Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.\" Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later (my God has it already been 16 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. \n10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he.",

            "text": "20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....",

The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it.

The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!For example the entire speech Morpheus says \"The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.\" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is.

This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "text": "In the late 90s, summer blockbusters were really suffering quality. There were films like Godzilla, Armageddon, deep impact etc. Point is that these summer blockbuster movies only focused on special effects due to the groundbreaking effects of Jurassic Park, and forgot to give us engaging stories and compelling characters, which became tiresome. In 1999, the matrix was released and blew everyone's mind. The audience were talking about how deep and philosophical, cerebral film it is, something new and innovative. But is it really that? The answer is, to be honest, no. The idea of a society that realize their reality is an illusion and have to fight authorities is not really new. It has been done in TV episodes, satire, books and many other medium. In fact, even anime did that idea before, just 4 years prior (ghost in the shell). The film is very much outdated, silly, pretentious and not as smart as the movie thinks it is.There are major problems with the movie, particularly the characters. The characters are so dull, uninteresting and bland that it is so hard to get invested in them. Morpheus is your typical mentor figure, Trinity is a boring character, with so little expressions to show and have zero chemistry with Neo, the main character. There is no reason for her to be in love with him. There has not been a single scene which indicates they should be together. And as for Neo, he is as interesting as a plank of wood, having almost no personality, poor facial expressions. And to top it off, there hasn't been a solid proof why he is \"the one\". There isn't anything special about him, he doesn't have any leadership skills, he doesn't even know what AI is or what EMP stands for.There is also another major problem. And it's a huge plot hole in the film. Why is there a matrix? Why is this system needed? The humans are planted, so why need to give them a matrix? All they need to do is just find a way to keep the human energy alive. The film is so pretentious, and has this confidence that is smart, but has one of the most cop out endings in a blockbuster movie. Trinity saves Neo with the power of love. How is something like that left in a \"cerebral\", \"philosophical\" movie, when it has an ending that belongs in fairy tales? It's stupid, forced and doesn't add up.So for all the rant this review has, is the film terrible? Not quite. In fact, it's a decent movie with some clever ideas and analogies, and props for having a major impact on film making and actually trying to do something different in the action genre as well as blockbuster movies, but it's not really the masterpiece it is claimed to be. It's outdated and is deeply flawed. But to some extent, it is understandable why many people love it.",

Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.By the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad.",

And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).But the movie has plot as well.  It has characters that I cared about.  From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action \"hero that kicks butt\" and \"cannon fodder\" roles.  I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion.  It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes!  Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before.  Watch one of the fight scenes.  Then watch the whole movie.  There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters.  Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE.

            "text": "I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like \"What are they, kidding?\", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who's previous film, Batman Begins, didn't really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he's inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he's going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham's mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the \"Classy Villain that Gotham needs\", he also has brought a new thought into Batman's head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham's \"White Knight\" trying to put all of Gotham's scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone's going crazy over Heath Ledger's performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath's and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don't wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can't come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I've seen it twice in one weekend, I'm going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don't mind one bit. I can't wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10",

We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there.",

It's filled with hard-hitting action and almost every scene is absolutely enthralling to watch. The story is really good. The twists and turns keep the viewer constantly on their toes, especially in the third act of the movie. There are so many memorable scenes packed throughout this movie, so many quotes and ideas sprinkled throughout that you probably could analyze it for hours.Because while the action and story is incredible, it is the dynamic between the Batman and the Joker that really makes this movie what it is. It is all in the contrast between the two. Right against wrong. Chaos and anarchy versus order. The Joker is the perfect villain for Batman. Batman is literally, as said in the movie, a symbol. The very essence of the idea of the Batman is centered around order, rules and moral codes. He is the embodyment of what is right. The Joker challenges the very core and foundation of who Batman is and what he stands for. He is someone who doesn't follow any rules. He is pure chaos and anarchy personified. As he so perfectly states in the third act of the movie, while hanging upside down off of a building: \"this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object\". The Joker wants the Batman to go against his morals and to break his rules. The powerful thing is also that you can see why the Joker does what he does. In some ways he has a point and that also adds another layer to the character and to the dynamic between the two. It is truly an amazing battle. The brilliant acting from Heath Ledger is a major part of it too. He is absolutely incredible as the Joker. Rest in peace.I could probably go on further about how great I think this movie is but I'll just say this. Just watch the movie. You should watch the first movie of the trilogy first but if that is something you absolutely don't wan't to do I still think you should see this movie. It is just great.",

Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience.

Being a huge fan of Batman and the two Burton films I couldn't wait to see it. While I never saw it in cinemas, I remember my friends telling me it was amazing and one of the best films ever. Fast forward to when I finally got to see the film and it was a different story.Two and a half hours of the most pretentious, boring and disappointing film I had ever seen. Lets start with the plot(s). Basically, the Joker (atleast that's what they call him) starts killing people and causing mayhem, meaning Batman has to stop him. Sounds simple but the film spoils this by having too many plot lines, most of which have nothing to do with the actual plot, don't last long enough to be interesting and could have been easily cut out to make a shorter and easier to follow plot.Now for the hero and villain. Batman is played by Christian Bale and comes complete with an over the top gruff voice, which sounds like he smoked a entire packet of cigarettes while doing a cross country marathon. He's nowhere near as dark or as intimidating as Keaton's Batman and isn't very engaging as Bruce either. Now for the reason the film is considered to be so great, Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger is the main driving point of the film and the most interesting character. He plays the role very convincingly and I'll admit is the best part of the film, even though they could have called him anything else instead of 'the Joker' and it would have been the same.And that's my biggest problem with this film, it doesn't feel like a Batman film. Batman has always been a surreal franchise, meaning it walks on a line between the real world and a fantasy world. Why does Gotham City just look like and regular city? Why does the Joker not have any comical death contraptions? Why does the Batmobile look like a tank? Where are all Batman's unique gadgets? The problem is Nolan doesn't understand that a man who dresses up as a Bat and fight crime can't be taken completely seriously. Burton made a surreal world for Batman and Batman Returns, creating a perfect environment for his films. But with Nolan, all I think of is just a crime drama with Batman in it. The Joker could have been just a psycho with makeup.The pacing is also a flaw. Sometimes the film moves too quickly for us to digest what's going on and other time it goes to slow that we lose interest. Only reason people loved it was for Heath Ledger's amazing performance and his unfortunate passing away before the film's release, and even that doesn't fit the bill for a 'Batman' movie. To sum up, 'The Dark Knight' will go down in history as the most overrated film ever made.",

It's well made, with great shots and good acting (at least by Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Heath Ledger). The action scenes are filmed more coherently than Batman Begins and that pencil trick was awesome.Still, there are too many ridiculous scenes (like flying out of a window with a cable attached to a plane and cell phones turning into radar machines) and completely unnecessary plot lines. Do I really care if Commissioner Gordon plays dead for half the film and his wife gets mad at him or some Chinese guy is hording the criminal's cash? No. Give us more confrontation between the hero and villain. Lastly, the dark themes this film deals with are taken a little too seriously for a movie about a superhero of sorts. He wears a cape and a mask and fights crime as a symbol... don't try and get me emotionally involved in any THEME greater than that. Develop the characters and make me care about them. The animated \"Batman and the Mask of the Phantasm\" did a better job with that.Whatev, i've rambled long enough. It's still a very enjoyable movie and if I see it again i'll probably like it more but there's no way this deserves all the praise it gets. I'd really give it a 6.5 out of ten but we can't do .5s and this definitely does not belong in the top movies of all time.

With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\"  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\"  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.",

No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home.

            "text": "I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel \"Star Wars\" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for \"Dark Knight\".Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, \"Dark Knight\" ably stands on its own with or without \"Batman Begins\". At a two and a half hour runtime, it's definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson's portrayal is true unpredictability. It's obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn't easy. How exactly does one take him down when he's woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the \"Batman\" animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in \"Batman Forever\", he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can't represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we've seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight's upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City's dark underside.\"The Dark Knight\" gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.",

Batman is a mere mortal with lots of time to train himself physically and money to design the nifty gadgets he uses.Everybody on earth has seen this film, so no use regurgitating the plot. I think Heath Ledger's rendition of The Joker is a masterpiece. Every time he leaves the screen I keep waiting for him to come back. Ledger should have won the best actor Oscar rather than supporting actor, because this is really a two leading man film - Bale as Batman and Ledger as The Joker. I always liked Jack Nicholson's rendition of the Joker in the 1989 film directed by Tim Burton, but Ledger just blows Nicholson's performance away. Maybe it is because Nicholson's Joker had a past and an explanation for his behavior, maybe it is because, after all, Nicholson's Joker just seems to be the wild side of the real Jack Nicholson where Heath Ledger never steps out of character for the entire film. Ledger's Joker is like the devil decides to become incarnate, but unlike Ray Milland's devil in \"Alias Nick Beal\" shows his true self - somebody who wants to break the spirits of people, to turn them on one another, to wantonly destroy property, people, whatever. That's reinforced when the police can find no name, no past, no prints, no DNA, not even a label in his clothes when they arrest him. His past is a great big question mark. I like Michael Caine's Alfred - it's good to have someone with relevant past combat and guerrilla experience be a wise father figure to Wayne in this role rather than just a kindly museum piece. Likewise, Morgan Freeman is pitch perfect as Lucius and Wayne's version of Q - somebody who invents his gadgets and runs his business since this really is not where Wayne's mind is, Freeman gives the performance the perfect balance of humor, business acumen, and conscience. And finally I like the fact that Rachel, Bruce Wayne's love interest, is not played by someone who is some unrealistic 10.5/10. She's a cute girl, but her attributes lie in her mind and her heart as well.The negatives - I think Harvey's transformation into Two Face is a little too pat. I don't know why Batman has a totally different voice from Bruce Wayne. Is he doing that on purpose? And I think I found one editing error. Gordon in the end talks about how hard it will be to cover up Harvey/ Two Face's murders including \"two cops\". Harvey let crooked cop Ramirez live and just knocked her out. But if she had lived then Gordon and Batman's plan to cover up Harvey's crimes would never have worked because she would have known what happened. So which scene was wrongly included/scripted? I'd recommend it as one of the better films made since the turn of the century that was also a blockbuster.",

            "text": "I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the 'Old Days' of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we're given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger's performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you'd remember from any other film. It's impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you're laughing.If Ledger wasn't enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's 'fallen White Knight' and Batman's direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal look like children's breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman's 'conscience' and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the 'majestic but unfinished' tones of Begins - but it suits the film's tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn't quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn't what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn't) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn't already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous 'Superhero' adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn't campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could've been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won't regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I'll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don't like it, then that's also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won't take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can't wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!",

            "text": "I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film \"Batman Begins,\" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with \"Batman Begins.\" Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale's tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale's flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger's Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman's worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (\"Thankyou for Smoking\") as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent's love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal's performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman's Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister's cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (\"Superman\" and \"X-Men\" are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan's flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!",

This prequel to the 1971 classic maintains the atmosphere and dread of the original while adding a few of its own twists and turns to the lore for better or worse.Exploring the dark forces behind Damien's birth is one of the best parts of the First Omen. The tension that builds up to the final act is equally as compelling. Thankfully there were only a few cheap jump scares with the film opting for more disturbing imagery. There were many scenes where you knew something was going to happen but all you could do was either watch it play out or turn away. If you do decide to stick with it you will find the graphic moments satisfyingly disturbing. The First Omen does not disappoint when it comes to fully utilizing its R-rating.One of the worst aspects of the film is the narrative. Hauntings kind of just happen for no particular reasons and some of the changes to the lore in The Omen don't quite jive not just with the original but within the context of The First Omen itself. All of the actors did an amazing job in their respective roles but a majority of the supporting characters needed more development.

Back in time, anybody would have taken it as a great sequel to Roman Polanski's \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), but it came as a different film and a different franchise. Polanski's classic was about the \"Birth of the Antichrist,\" and The Omen walked on the same lines, as we saw a couple adopting the \"Baby Antichrist.\" Making a prequel to a cult classic flick after 6 decades is not easy and definitely not the same job. The filmmaking style of the 1970s, the use of camera and background score, movie codes, and graphical violence-everything has changed over the years, so you can't really continue using the same formula to do a service to the old classic. Also, you don't have a legendary actor like Gregory Peck to lead the show. He was, back then, one of the rare legendary actors to do a cult horror film after Boris Karloff (Frankenstein), Bela Lugosi (Dracula), Claude Rains (The Wolf Man), and Fredric Marc (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), but he didn't play the ghost/devil but a victim instead. That takes a lot of load away from The First Omen, as it comes with low expectations since all the previous films in the franchise (excluding the first one) have either been disappointing or mediocre. Surprisingly enough, this one goes wild, gruesome, and cruel enough to revive the franchise to some level, so this surprise should be welcomed by fans.Set in 1971 in Rome, The First Omen takes you to the events before American diplomat Robert Thorn and his wife Kathy were given the baby Antichrist, aka Damien. Margaret Daino (Nell Tiger Free), an American girl, is sent to Rome to work at an orphanage before taking the veil. She meets a disturbed girl, Carlita Skianna (Nicole Sorace), who is seeing some visions that can't be true but are true. Margaret befriends her roommate, Luz Valez (Maria Caballero), who takes her to the bar to have some fun. That BC-time-old cliche of a girl and a boy meeting at the bar, having drinks, dancing, kissing, and going to bed takes the story forward, but for many smart viewers, the climax twist is over at that moment only. Carlita is suspected to be the girl who will give birth to the Antichrist, and Margaret wants to save her. With the help of Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson), she is off to find the mystery behind the evil number \"666\" and how it is connected to Carlita and other women who have suffered the same fate in the orphanage.Being a prequel is difficult because the audience already knows the climax. The First Omen suffers from the same problem because we already know what the climax is. Damien is already with Kathy and Robert in \"The Omen\" (1976), so we know Margaret failed to stop them. This isn't a spoiler, but a basic guess anyone could easily know. Therefore, Ben Jacoby's story hasn't really anything to offer, but there is something in the screenplay for you. Tim Smith, Arkasha Stevenson, and Keith Thomas's screenwriting gives you a hell of a \"HORROR\" show. You might puke or feel sick sometimes while seeing this macabre series of visuals. It's disturbing, filthy, obscene, and somewhat vulgar too. Particularly for female audiences, who are generally more sensitive to such things, and I did witness some disgusting expressions in the cinema hall from them during my screening. The jump scares like The Nun, Annabelle, and The Conjuring are low, but the horrible and ridiculous visuals come in a higher quantity. Beware of them if you can't digest them. And if you love them, then get ready for a feast! Yumm or yuck, you decide. I leave that decision to you. One more decision should be left to audiences, and that is whether or not this film hurts the religious sentiments of \"Christianity.\" A soon-to-be nun going to the bar, smoking cigarettes, discussing sexual desires from the past-I mean, I am not sure if they are allowed to do so. The experts can be better judges than me.Nell Tiger Free wins you with her cuteness from the very first scene. After a while, the character and her expressions start boring you, as nothing compelling comes out of it. The climax, however, gives Nell to go free with some barbaric theories. Nell is fantastic in that pregnancy scene when she behaves like she is having an epilepsy attack. It gets on your nerves. That's only until you see the baby scene, which is even more thrilling. A mother can't just kill her own baby, even if it's the devil. Mia Farrow pushed the cradle in the iconic ending frame of Rosemary's Baby, leaving us shattered with her motherhood duties, and in the same way, we have Margaret's hand shaking here. Nicole Sorace has done well for the kind of weird character she got, while Luz Valez is a total babe! Ralph Ineson makes the father more relevant and believable than anyone else could have done. The supporting cast, including Sônia Braga, Bill Nighy, Tawfeek Barhom, and Charles Dance, looked quite decent.As mentioned earlier, the filmmaking style has evolved to whole new proportions from the 1970s to 2024. Aaron Morton's camera uses ultra-close-up shots of the eyes, stomach, vagina, and many other things to make you feel the horrors, fear, and strangeness of the characters and the moments they are going through. The background score has been effective, and a special mention should go to the editing skills of Bob Murawski and Amy E. Duddleston for cutting the scenes in such manners that they turn out to be unbearably horrifying. Some frightening scenes don't go well, as they cause ridiculous laughs, which is a common case with today's horror movies. The First Omen misses out on psychological nuances that could have made it more intense and gripping. Nonetheless, The First Omen is too good to be a directorial debut for anyone. Arkasha Stevenson has done what many filmmakers couldn't do, which is to resurrect the old classic in a modern way. Of course, it is no match for the first OG flick by Richard Donner, but it's far better than the mediocrity others offered us on the goodwill of \"The Omen.\" A few hiccups don't bother much, so this one deserves to be seen and experienced on the big screen. Go to the nearest cinema hall for a night/late-night show as gruesome entertainment awaits you.RATING - 6/10*",

            "text": "\"The First Omen\" presents itself as a technically well-produced film, with a decent budget evident in its sets and successfully recreated atmosphere of the 1970s, providing a visually appealing experience. The soundtrack and sound effects also stand out, using characteristic sounds of the era to build the temporal setting of the work. The performances of the actors, especially Nell Tiger Free and Nicole Sorace, are convincing. Despite the plot about the Antichrist and diabolical pregnancy not bringing anything new to the horror genre, the film manages to entertain the viewer solidly and competently.However, I found it difficult to fully engage with the narrative, unlike what happened with the film \"Immaculate.\" And although \"The First Omen\" is competent, it doesn't stand out enough to distinguish itself from other works in the horror genre.SPOILERS\nThe explanation that the church is creating the Antichrist and the revelation that the protagonist is the daughter of the devil are aspects that do not fit cohesively into the plot, resulting in a confusing explanation that hampers the narrative development. Additionally, the revelation of the protagonist's origin ends up being predictable due to the clues left throughout the film, reducing the emotional impact of the revelation. For example: the lack of contextualization about the protagonist's past and the evident clues of her demonic origins contribute to a less impactful revelation.",

            "text": "The First Omen: Though similar in plot to Immaculate at a superficial level, this film sticks to the supernatural in the attempts to create the Antichrist. In the prologue an aged Father Harris (Charles Dance) is tracked down by Father Brennan (Ralph Ineson), Harris relates a garbled tale about a baby created through a woman mating with the Devil. The progeny is destined to be the mother of the Antichrist. Shortly afterwards Father Harris is showered by stained glass and a piece of scaffolding takes a chunk out of his head, obviously just happenstance. Rome, 1971, Margaret (Nell Tiger Free) arrives from the US to take her vows at a school/orphanage, herself an orphan, she was raised by the Roman Catholic Church. She is met by Cardinal Lawrence (Bill Nighy) who a decade before had counselled her when she was having troubles. They travel to the Convent to the background of Trade Union and Student protests; the Cardinal reflects on how the RCC is also losing the support of young people. These disturbances continue in the background over the radio until Margaret is caught up in a riot during a pivotal scene,The Convent seems to be a happy place, the children are treated well, they have parties, nuns bounce on trampolines, even the elder sisters smoke and crack jokes. However Margaret finds that one child Carlita (Nicole Sorace) is often kept in a room, tied to a bed even. Carlita acts up, is violent, draws strange pictures, Margaret realises that Carlita is acting like she did years ago, so she bonds with her. Similar to Immaculate there is a naughty novitiate, Luz (Maria Caballero) she browbeats Carlita into going dancing and drinking, after all one must live before leaving secular life. Things take an odd turn at the orphanage, Carlita has terrifying visions, a strange young nun, Angelica connects with both Margarey and Carlita. Father Brennan reappears and tries to convince Margaret that a conspiracy is at play to create the Antichrist. The plot now takes an interesting turn which it would be a spoiler to reveal.The First Omen is a largely satisfying film in its own right and promises to take the franchise off at an angle to the previous films. There are scenes of graphic horror, not least in the birth scenes where elements of body horror are introduced along with Margaret's visions of the risen dead. Some good jump scares but the pacing of the film takes away from the effect of a couple of these. A tightening up of the convent scenes with additional exposition of Margaret's backstory might have improved the flow of the narrative. Nell Tiger Free's part demands a lot and she is equal to it as her character develops. Maria Caballero is wonderful in her nunsploitation role in the nightclub scenes and in her dress sense, this sequence and her later taking of vows introduces a touch of Dario Argento. Nicole Sorace gives a fine performance as the disturbed and conflicted young girl.. Bill Nighy gives further support as the enigmatic and pragmatic Cardinal. Of course The First Omen introduces a few characters who featured in the 1976 film The Omen and even pays homage to several of its gory death scenes (improving on at least one of those). Directed by Arkasha Stevenson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Tim Smith and Keith Thomas from a story by Ben Jacoby. 8/10.",

Why Satan didn't like fire for example was inconsistent with the entire history of Catholicism. Also the ending was very contrived to ensure a sequel could be resurrected if needed.The setting was an orphanage for girls run by nuns so there was an interesting archetypal ambience about motherhood, which worked very well for the film.

            "text": "'The First Omen (2024)' is surprisingly good for a prequel to a horror classic. It's also remarkably similar to 'Immaculate (2024)', to the point that one would seem to have ripped off the other if it had been released significantly later (the tiny gap between the two films' release dates indicates a case of parallel thinking, rather than plagiarism). Its most valuable asset is its direction, which makes use of assured cinematography and measured pacing to deliver some really well-achieved sequences that are typically as unsettling as they are atmospheric. The picture is often dripping with dread, evoking this intangible sense that what you're seeing is actually evil. With an unrelentingly ominous soundtrack, some really confronting imagery and the overall texture - both aesthetic and narrative - of something straight out of the seventies, the film carves its own unholy mark on the genre and is often really compelling (even during its more obviously silly moments). Its pacing does wane slightly in its second act, and its central mystery - or, at least, where it's heading - is unfortunately really obvious if you've seen 'The Omen (1976)' (or even read the tagline). I guessed the movie's major twist within the first few moments, for instance, and being ahead of the narrative doesn't do the experience any favours considering its enigma is pretty much its main driving force. Even if you aren't able to see the reveal coming, the film's main problem still has a strong impact. The issue is that it has to tie in to the original, which severely diminishes the potential - and power - of its third act. The finale just feels incredibly boxed in, and it doesn't help that the flick isn't content to just strongly imply. Instead, it feels the need to spell out, with a rushed epilogue that ends on a namedrop that's intended to carry weight but actually just feels weird. It's not as if the rest of the movie is exactly subtle, but the climax feels like a total sledgehammer in the worst possible way (not in terms of its in-universe implications, but its meta ones). It's bending to the studio's idea of what it needs to be, rather than what it it's been naturally building towards. However, this obviously top-level interference isn't enough to significantly reduce the overall effectiveness of the affair. It's still a really accomplished in-the-moment experience, despite its legitimate narrative issues. The direction really is rock-solid, as are most of the performances, and there's a palpable sense of foreboding throughout. A lot of the set-pieces are rather unsettling, too. It's ultimately a strong effort that suffers most from being part of a wider franchise, yet is also far better than you may expect an entry in said franchise to be. If its third act was a little better, it could have been great. As it is, it's still really good.",

The signature of the Omen franchise is that the deaths occur with a Rube Goldberg clockwork precision (later incorporated in the Final Destination films) coupled with an Alan Silvestri soundtrack that conveyed intent and malice. In short, it was clear that Satan was watching over his son. There were also cumbersome rules about how a mortal could kill the antichrist, all making for great tension.The preview for this film hinted at this with scenes filmed in reverse....not in the movie. The first 2 deaths pay obvious homage to the original movie but lack the malice and intent.

During her time at the church, she learns about hidden, dark actions at the church as they seek to bring the Antichrist to life.With this prequel they respond well to the original Omen film from 1976. This original film has already had sequels, spin-offs and a remake. All these films after the original Omen often did not work very successfully, but this new prequel seems to change that after years. With this prequel they respond well to the story that happened before the original film. They know how to create a good, exciting, but also equal atmosphere with this new Omen film. The only disadvantage of the fact that the film responds so well to the original Omen film is that it can make this prequel a bit predictable at times. As a connoisseur of the classic Omen film, you can anticipate this prequel.In addition to the predictable aspects that the film can have for connoisseurs, the film also has an incorrect outcome date. This film is very similar to the horror film Immaculate, which was released in cinemas a week earlier. Due to the similar horror stories, it can feel a bit repetitive when you see these two films in two weeks in a row.With horror aspects, with this film they do not play much on horror clichés such as lame jump scares, but manage to create a more religious horror atmosphere around the birth of the Antichrist. This is not a sadistic body horror film, but focuses more on the aspects involved in birth. They seem to have used so many real effects for this, which also made some more of the cast members ragged.Nell Tiger Free also carries this film as the lead, who learns about dark secrets in her church. Together with the other cast members, she and the rest play the characters well and appropriately enough, making it seem like they are also from the 1976 film.",

The script is a prequel that tells us the story of Damien Thorn's birth, and it does so in an effective and gloomy way, at times it seems predictable but soon there are wonderfully designed twists, as well as including tribute scenes to the first film from 1976. The director Arkasha Stevenson's work is first class, she tells this story in a slow way that is full of emotions, together with the editing work, the film gives a result of art cinema, with the vein of current classics such as \"The VVitch\" (2015), \"Heriditary\" (2018) or \"Suspiria\" (2018) to name a few. The art direction and filming locations were carefully chosen, resulting in a visual delight that the cinematography manages to exalt in each scene. The costume design transports you to the beginning of the '70s, although sometimes it falls into anachronisms such as extras who wear costumes that belong to the mid- and late '70s and not the beginning of these, there is even disco music that in 1971 had not yet been played, an example is the classic \"Daddy Cool\" by Boney M. The soundtrack by Mark Korven is an auditory delight and evokes the soundtrack he made for \"The VVitch\" in 2015. The effects are well done, it is appreciated to be able to see old school special effects, with the exception of a couple of scenes that use digital effects but decent and moderately. The makeup effects are realistic and gloomy. The film, being a co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada and Serbia, provides elements that are reminiscent of Italian cinema from the '70s, in addition to paying tribute to classics such as \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), \"Suspiria\" (1977), \"Possession\" (1981) and remembering the atmosphere that \"The Omen\" trilogy gave a gift in its time. \"The First Omen\" is a formidable film, the best horror film of the year so far.",

Predictable plot as well which never truly disturbed unlike its prequel, almost disrespects the 1976 classic. Nevermind. The promising title, the idea wasn't too bad either, I must've had too high expectations Could've been so much more than just chopped limbs and horrifying nuns. As for ancient Rome's sightseeing, it wasn't too bad to watch...Ritual birth in a dungeon, the usual candle fire and crucifix, victim stripped to a gurney surrounded by complicit nuns is so cliche. Even the notorious birthmark was too predictable. Just copy paste it into the next Omen, the one after, and it's done... Typically, some of it reminded me of a similar plot inspired from classics like \"Rosemary's Baby\" (take note of the baby's claws). Like the actual first born could be just as well an \"Aliens\" rip- off. Based on the 2006 prequel (Mia Farrow) confusingly The First Omen could be just as well watched in reverse order. Appropriate 6/6 rating.",

It's clear to me that this movie was made to go in a certain direction in hopes of a possible sequel or two. Hence Flaw #1: Damian's mother was a jackal (he was born of a Jackal) as clearly stated in the Original Omen. This movie, The First Omen has him being born of a human mother with some incest & jackal DNA mixed in. Damian was also born with a fraternal twin sister. You'll have to watch The First Omen to understand this more I won't go into it here. It seems some creative liberty was taken to add a human mother and twin sister for possible sequels, hence the ending. On to Flaw #2: As we all know, according to the Bible only the Anti-Christ will bear the mark of the beast (666). However, in The First Omen the human mother and what I guess would be Damian's Aunt also bear the mark. This is a serious departure from the Bible. Those are the two major flaws but there are many more smaller ones and story line inconsistencies.",

            "text": "\"The First Omen\" is a prequel that is difficult for me to analyze in its entirety, since from my point of view it is like two films in one.If we were to analyze the story without connecting it to \"The Omen\" from 1976, we are faced with a great horror film, technically impeccable and supported by a superb performance by Nell Tiger Free, which can go seamlessly from virginal innocence to a dignified demonic convulsion of Isabelle Adjani from \"Possession\". The only thing that muddies that film are the final minutes where an unnecessary (but inevitable in these times) feminist/lesbian turn appears and the possible continuation with an She-Antichrist (already used topic, since there was Damien's daughter in the failed fourth installment).The problem is when we want to connect this film with the original. Except for a few very interesting winks throughout the entire plot, the story presents such gross inconsistencies that, for those who have seen the films and read the books, it is impossible to put together a coherent puzzle.One of the basic points of connection is Father Brennan, the one who reveals the truth to Robert Thorn about his son. Here we see him some years before and the physical resemblance is well achieved, but that's as far as the issue ends, because they are two characters that are too different from each other. In \"The First Omen\" Brennan receives information from another priest that they are trying to bring the Antichrist into the world and sets out to investigate, warn and, as far as possible, prevent the event. Radically different is the Brennan of \"The Omen\", there (both in the film and in the expanded data of the novelization) we see that he was an active part of the \"Sect of Rome\", a satanic cult whose primary mission was to bring the Antichrist, who was one of the midwives present at the birth of the Beast, who killed Thorn's royal son with a blow to the head (and a few other \"little things\", like sexually abusing an African child). Clearly it is an absolute incoherence that means that they cannot even be matched with Super Glue.The Rome Sect also does not resemble the religious group that, according to the Brennan of 1971, has as its motivation to bring the son of the Devil so that people believe in God again, since \"the youth is in permanent agitations.\" On the contrary, the Sect of the original was itself the one in charge of promoting the agitations. In fact, Brennan is sent to Uganda to conspire and achieve the victory of Idi Amin. That sect was a satanic cult that had priests inside, it was not a faction of the Church as it is now portrayed in this new film.But if all this were not enough to make one work and the other unconnected, we would find ourselves with the worst of nonsense. In \"The Omen\" Brennan warns Thorn that the mother of his child was a jackal (the father is not mentioned because it is understood that it was Lucifer himself and that the Beast was conceived in a kind of \"immaculate conception\"). In the Cerveteri cemetery, Thorn and Jennings discover two graves and in one of them is the mother's skeleton: a jackal. Well, in this one the mother is a woman fathered by a monster (which would be the Devil) and \"a devotee\" who is seen at the beginning of the film. And this woman survives and flees. She means that, if we abide to the original story, nothing that is seen here makes any sense (and we already saw that there was little left): if the mother was a jackal, almost nothing that is told now is true.For this and many more items \"The First Omen\" is a very good horror film but impossible to fit correctly into the universe of \"The Omen\", no matter how much it appears the photo of Gregory Peck and the chords of \"Ave Satani\" sounds.",

By the third act, it loses all integrity and becomes laughable in places. The way the shark flips the RIB and everyone out of it, the speed in which it kills swimmers in the triathlon, the shells all going off and every bridge collapsing along the river. The list goes on.There's some decent special effects throughout, especially of the traumatic amputations in the catacombs and of the sharks in general but the head of police and the mayor are extremely caricature and kill the depth of the story in my opinion even if the special effects were faultless.Worth a watch but it's not a classic or a film you'll revisit, even if you're after a brain-disengage-type film.",

There's an \"explanation\" as to why and if you suspend your belief for a second there, you can just experience this as a slightly silly but still okay one-time watch. If \"Bait\" could have sharks roaming a flooded grocery store, France can have sweet water sharks.Story: Far-fetched but fun enough.Length: Could easily have been 20-25 minutes shorter.Acting: Mediocre to good.CGI: Not entirely realistic and partly gave 2000's videogame vibes. (For instance when the shark pulls Sophia far down into the deep sea in the first few minutes of the film.)\nFor the most part, however, it's good enough.I think even more shocking than killer sharks under Paris was seeing the massive amounts of trash us humans pump into the ocean. Perspective. Didn't expect an aquatic horror movie to make me sad but here we are, fam.Typical clichés include strong female protagonist having trauma that she overcomes by the end of the movie (if you think this is a spoiler you were probably born in the late 2000's) and they borrowed a bit from \"Deep Blue Sea\" with the abnormal evolution of super-shark Lilith, who, I guess, is kind of aptly named after Biblical Adam's first wife whom God cursed to become a ravenous monster/child eater because she refused to be subjugated by Adam.Good shark movies live off of two things: the suspense (where is it?! When will it attack? How? From where?!) and great action (aarrghhh! Where's my leg! And so on). The suspense was there in the beginning, then is drawn out ad nauseam until there's nothing left of it. Activists debating endlessly how to save the shark and getting in the police's way...people diving under the Seine with no shark in sight...people walking through tunnels...then finally around the one hour mark: a fin! It is she! Great Lilith. And she brought her baby. Here's where Lilith earned her Biblical name cause she suddenly and without warning...eats it. Plus the annoying blue-haired activist, thank Gods for small miracles.It takes another whopping 20 minutes to see another shark, or rather a whole school of sharks - Lilith's offspring - at the start of the triathlon. People die, there's a bomb, dramatic violins play as the police and military start firing machine guns into the water, half of Paris is somehow flooded...and still this was one of the most boring shark films I've ever watched.The conclusion is that the sharks weren't just serial killers mindlessly ripping anyone to shreds they encountered but they wanted Paris flooded to live there. Um. Why? The Seine ends in the English channel. Lilith literally made it there and could have left anytime if this was a space issue. Also this implies more than a human-like intelligence but almost magical powers because how on earth would the shark know people have bombs and how they'd react to an aquatic threat of this magnitude? Come on. There's fiction and then there's nonsense. It had good elements but the fun(ny) parts were overshadowed by how seriously the movie took itself.So in the end, this was another underwhelming shark film. Stick to the classics: The Shallows, the first two 47 Meters Down movies, Deep Blue Sea, Bait, Jaws, The Reef and if you feel goofy, The Meg.",

It wasnt super bad and the actors are pretty ok, but ofc there are lots of 'dumb' people that fall into the water, that run around like idiots and ofcourse there is a government not believing things etc etc.The CGI at some points was pretty ok but at various times it failed to deliver (specially when the shark jumps out of the water), but hey... at least it's not another sharknado type of movie (although that one doesnt take itself to serious and that might be even better).The ending of this movie was another failure imo with to much questions still left to be answered... or will there be a part 2? Who knows. Overall... nice for a one time view but if you compare it with for example 47 meters down... this is nowhere near.",

It spends too much time on its admittedly well intentioned premise and goes too long between shark encounters. However, it's saved by the thoroughly serious tone combined with a third act that finally realises its full potential and just goes for broke.It wants to be one of those rare creature features where you actually care about the characters so it dedicates a lot of screen time to their struggles and past failures and yet they still feel one dimensional overall but it at least understands to give the most annoying character a memorable death. Nassim Lyes manages to make his character likeable on performance alone.Xavier Gens' direction is helped massively by the 15 rating which allows him to actually show the brutality of the shark attacks, which can create some tension in the really impressive underwater sequences. The fact that there's no in-jokes and everyone takes this completely seriously even as it starts to get into gleefully stupid territory was absolutely the right choice as well.",

Anne Marivin does a good job playing a completely incompetent, dishonest, ruthless, politically driven mayor of Paris that everyone will recognize easily.

This movie truly was not \"important\" enough to tell it over 131 minutes. Add to that there were pointless extended shots that you were begging to end. At about 100 minutes in, audience members were looking at their cellphones either to check the time or they were getting restless.Second, there were excessive timeline jumps. It is often a useful story-telling device, but here it was excessive and distracting - so much so that when they did another timeline jump there was a consensus \"groan.\" Making matters worse, is that there were time jumps as long as 13 years. However, Zendaya --- bless her heart --- as much as they tried to \"age\" her and \"de-age\" her through hair and make-up, she never looked, to me, older than about 17 years old regardless of the time era.Third, while I credit Zendaya for tackling such a meaty role, and as much as I otherwise adore her, she just simply seemed to young to be so \"weathered\" and \"jaded\" and \"cynical\" and \"ruthless\" and \"calculating\" as she was. Further, I really don't remember her smiling once throughout the movie. And as I have read in other reviews, she seemed to have a resting \"scowl\" throughout the movie - ironically very much similar to the scowl she had throughout both Dune 1 and 2.And lastly, by the end of the movie, none of the three characters were likeable, and, perhaps, oddly, sadly, Zendaya was, to me, the least likeable. And from a film character study point of view, the viewer is never given a reason or backstory for this.With all these distractions in mind, I was so eager for the movie to end that I lost all investment whatsoever in who won or lost in the story's big moment.",

At the US Open, they meet Tashi (the amazing Zendaya who really can do anything) and are both captivated. It is quickly noticed by Tashi that Art and Patrick seem to be more than best friends.Challengers takes us back and forth through time, bouncing rapidly just like a tennis ball crossing the court. When the two men both pursue Tashi, it is very clear that Tashi is the tennis ball during the intense relationship between the two men. She mentions early on that tennis is more than just a game, and boy does this film work those themes hard.The previews left out the fact that LGBTQ+ themes are explored, but with subtlety. The sexual tension between Art and Patrick is so thick, I was left wondering where their relationship was headed. Both men wanted Tashi, but only Art succeeded in marrying her.The tennis metaphor, and the literal matches, fill the movie with excitement and tension that never gets old or tired. Be prepared to pay close attention because of the rapid fire changes between the three leads. I know Zendaya gets top billing, but I still say that she's the tennis ball; being served between Patrick and Art.Also, I have to point out that my favorite soundtrack artists lately, Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch (yes Nine Inch Nails) did the music. They are popping up a lot lately in films, and they never disappoint.This movie was more of an erotic thriller than I thought it would be, because the previews barely touched on the real film. This is a movie worth talking about with friends, so please feel free to engage me. There is a lot left open for interpretation, and a couple of plot holes that weren't filled. One big example is Patrick shows signs of bruising near a vein in his arm. That's an obvious sign of drug abuse, but it's never mentioned other than it being noticed.Highly recommended film. I'm biased because I love tennis, but I'm a sucker when a literal theme is used as metaphor as well. Go see it. And seriously, hit me up afterwards, I'd love to hear other viewpoints, especially about the Fire and Ice.",

It lacks absolutely everything but occasional beautiful scenery.I remember Zendaya since Shake It Up and although she is a smart and lovely woman with indeniable star quality, her acting has never been convincing. She always positions herself perfectly for the shot, has the needed movement or expression, but it is always with more connection for the camera than with the character (even in Euphoria). I also never found her use of her voice adequate, it is usually one note. It sort of works here because Tashi is a character as flat as a pancake.The two other leads are no better and it is an already very far fetched idea that they would attract the attention of anyone, let alone of someone like the Tashi character.And if this was a movie to attract tennis fans... well it won't. None of the tree leads looks like they have ever played sport. Any sport, any kind, not professionally, just any at all. In school, in the backstreet with friends. The director is either very incapable of his job or hasn't either. They hired Brad Gilbert to consult and help. Ok, but he helps with the wrong aspects. In the end of the day a general viewer would not care if the serve technique is correct, or if the movement and speed is accurate. But he would care about the absolute lack of any engagement with the game. No passion, no desire, no will, no care. Even Ivan Lendl has visibly shown more connection to the game and he was infamous for cool attitude. Or Andre Agassi or Nick Kyrgios who have stated many times they hated tennis. These actors look and act like they are trying not to trip, not to make a wrong move and not like playing for anything (not just the tenmis aspects of the movie). And from this there is no loud enough music to make you care about their game or desires.The music is terrible allthrough, loud and without having any connection with the supposed story. The overly in your face \"metaphors\" are just tiring at this point. Filmmakers might wanna try some new and fresh approach to get the point across.

I'll detail the scene I'll say is the best, but overall, the use of cameras, where they stand, and the masterpiece climax in the final scene, make the direction top-notch.The casting fits the script perfectly. Sometimes, it's the actors who determine the tension of a film, and in this film, our trio of leads creates a fantastic tension, very successfully.Thirdly, the use of sports as a tool. In normal sports films, the main focus is on the sport and the plane it creates, but Challengers goes beyond that and metaphorizes tennis very successfully. And tennis could truly be the most individual among individual sports, so it's a very apt choice. The metaphor of the tennis ball being Tashi, especially, enchanted me. The back and forth between Art and Pat, and finally Art winning because of the Grandslam, is not an easy metaphor.Fourthly, and the part I loved, the climax scene is amazing. Taking such a risk in shooting in such a different technique and jolting the audience in the theater with that scene is really well done. Putting the camera in place of the ball, drawing a bomb on the camera, shooting from different angles, all accompanied by a simple music that tells the tempo very well, is really the right move.Fifthly, the film's sexiness is very well placed. The love scenes are not exaggerated and really well placed. Maybe the red-lighted scene at the end is a bit swagger, but all the characters look very sexy. Congratulations to Zendaya, Mike Faist, and John O'Conner, good job.The point I didn't like is that the simple concept of family wasn't filled out enough, in my opinion. When Art and Tashi's child is mentioned, there should have been a flashback to that period and the importance of that in their lives should have been explained. Yes, the film is super-paced and great, but I feel it lacks something, and with a 5-6 minute scene added, the film could have been a 10/10 for me. Also, the focus on Pat's wound. Since we focused on it, we could have had 1 or 2 scenes of Pat's suffering as well.And finally, I want to address people's comments. I think the ratings are exactly what the film deserves, the positives are very dominant, but there are minimal shortcomings, so the ratings are just right. Some people have said (especially in my country), \"oh, we were very uncomfortable, it's exaggerated,\" etc. Dude, the whole point of the film is to try to explain a sick situation; all three characters have big personal problems; one worships people, the other worships sports (and of course, meaningless ambition and success), and the other behaves loosely and cowardly. Sorry, but it's silly to accept this situation as normal and make comments; excuse my bluntness, but watch the movie and try to understand it.The film is very enjoyable and flows excessively, not a second boring, watch it in the cinema.Additionally, some of the argument scenes in the film and the overall structure also resemble a tennis match, I forgot to explain (metaphor) that in my review, but I think this is also a major factor in the film's success. (For example, the argument scene between Tashi and Patrick in their rooms fits perfectly. This fight just like a tennis match.)",

The way the camera moves was CONSTANTLY fresh. One stop-motion-esque scene in particular --- but PLEASE, just go experience it for yourself. It's better than anything this year and will be bound to become an all time classic. There's nothing even remotely similar to this movie. The all-time most impressive thing about this movie is how at the start of the movie there is little attachment to the characters and then it reveals more and more layers until literally you are at the edge of your seat all the way up to the finish line. Layers and layers until, yes, a true CLIMAX. I don't write reviews, but this movie just grabbed me and excited me about film again. I'm home, sitting on my bed, and my heart is still pounding strong. This makes me want to create something. This is ART. 10/10.",

I'm not sure if this is the feeling I got because the characters lacked depth. In the beginning, it seemed like Zendaya's character is a nice girl and the boys are best friends who cherish each other's friendship. However, at some point Zendaya turns into a manipulative girlfriend and then wife, one boy turns into her weak husband and the other is... I don't know... still a naive boy? These turns and ups and downs in the storyline would make sense for me if they were shown gradually in the character development, which doesn't exist here. Bacause of this, the characters show weird and unexplicable behaviour. I don't think this is the problem of the actors, but it is clear that the script has a lot of holes, which make this movie more of a fun-night-out movie than something I will actually remember.",

She tried to move on but seeing other people less talented than her do what she was meant to do destroyed her and the desire of glory prevailed over love.In the very last moment we can say that something has been finally fixed in everyone and the great Luca Guadagnino let us imagine the rest.",

            "text": "Exhilarating. Energetic. Excellent.Luca Guadagnino's Challengers is a riveting, pulse-pounding, thrilling sports romance-drama that blew my mind. I loved, loved, LOVED Challengers - didn't know what to expect, and walked out of the theater totally buzzing. It's smart and sophisticated while still poppy and propulsive. This is cinema that will carve new neural pathways and an essential reminder that film is the director's medium. Luca Guadagnino gifts us the most erotic, expressionistic mid-budget studio drama in years.Challengers is electric. Every single second of this film is charged with a carnal passion for romance and sport. The chemistry between Zendaya, Mike Faist, and Josh O'Connor is utterly intoxicating, as is watching them navigate their pursuit of success in tennis as it becomes inseparable from their personal relationships. I must stress that all three are phenomenal in the film. Zendaya's work, however, is especially staggering. I will 100% be rewatching and overanalyzing everything in the film, but especially the brilliant subtleties in Zendaya's performance, ones that contribute to Tashi's poise and confidence, and how she formulates her strategy to finding the perfect match.There is so much style in every frame. The cinematography is exquisite and really creative, especially in the final tennis match. It has some of the best camerawork I have seen in a very long time. Much like the plot, it's playful and clever and keeps you on your toes. That final ten minutes is flawless filmmaking. The energy of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' techno score brings the house down with its heart-pounding and electric pulse of energy (The Reznor/Ross score is riveting and purposefully over-the-top on occasion, as it plays an integral role in (brilliantly) evoking specific emotions - it meshes so beautifully with the way these tennis scenes are so brilliantly edited), and that sound design, man it was awesome. And the editing - the story volleys back and forth in time, but the brilliant editing keeps the drama high. Some sequences had me full-on levitating.Challengers is sexy as hell with some Uncut Gems level stress and tension! The building and use of tension in the movie is masterful. The climax is powerful and leaves you wanting more but also gives you enough to know exactly what happens next. This movie is an ace. Absolutely insane filmmaking - Guadagnino is truly a master of his craft! The performances from the three leads are magnetic, the dual timeline storytelling is consistently engaging, and the tennis scenes are incredibly tense. The central trio here is astonishing with a complicated, messy, dramatic relationship that defies easy analysis - it is a love triangle on acid. AND it's an original film! Challengers is in the conversation for movie of the year. Game. Set. Match.",

Trailers for this were around almost a year ago, and every time I saw the trailer, I was thinking to myself 'oh not this again'. But a trailer does not make a movie.It has so much potential, It has a genius premise, and the ending of the film is pretty fantastic, but it's way too long, and a lot of the symbolism and mythos of the film is lost in the soap opera script and slow second act.My opinion, I believe that Tashi does not exist, she is some sort of subliminal image for the two leads, to help them reveal their true feelings. They are in love, and always have been. She really only ever interacts with the two men, and her daughter and mother are her past and future self, respectively. I realised this toward the end of the film, when Tashi just materialises in the hotel corridor. She simply isn't real.And thats the genius of the film, and it's downfall, as it could have been something so much more than the melodrama that it is. And herein lies the problems. The subliminal symbolism is just so in your face, that it almost spells it out to you that the two men are in love.For example, the scene where the two are eating churros is just 101 phallic symbolism, and the makers may have well just dressed the guys in effeminate clothing and left it at that.The makers treat the viewers like they are stupid, and it's insulting. We don't need to be spoon fed the narrative, we like to have opinions, and like to come to our own conclusions. I may be totally wrong, but it's what I got from the film, and in my honest opinion, I think that is the arc of the film.On the plus side, the tennis scenes are pretty well choreographed, and the majority of the score by Reznor is pretty enthralling, but now and again it gets a little too much, just like the film. And the camera loves to linger on Zendaya, sometimes so much, it's actually cringeworthy.So it's not an Ace film for me, in fact, it's not even 15-love.It's pretty boring.",

I don't think it added much to the movie but a lot to sell the trailer, just a little odd they chose to sell the trailer this way without adding anything to the story. Secondly the ending was just bad. Maybe unexpected but my subjective opinion would have had it end in any other way.

            "text": "Challengers is a film about obsession, a love story presented in a manner that mirrors the sport at the center of its narrative; fierce, kinetic, and competitive, but also indescribably intimate. The film is transgressive in many ways, challenging the spectator to think differently about love and desire by presenting protagonists who don't neatly fit into the romantic or erotic mold Hollywood has presented us with over the past several decades. Through these singular characters, director Luca Guadagnino achieves something unique: a perspective on the inherent push and pull of relationships that is so heightened it throws into stark contrast the dark desires we all harbor. This extremely niche story, therefore, becomes a kind of commentary on what love makes of all of us: fanatics.The film isn't only resonant thematically; as usual, Guadagnino's direction is a tour de force of exciting choices that push his actors to the limits of expression, presented to us against the backdrop of visually arresting aesthetics. The standout performances are definitely those of Zendaya and Josh O'Connor, but all three protagonists have an intense, seductive chemistry with one another that reads as so authentic, so fervent, so genuine, that the love scenes (which really only extend to kissing) caught me off guard. For those two hours, I believed these people (in some configuration) were in love, which is a crucial buy-in for the audience.I hesitate to call this an \"erotic thriller\" because that phrase brings to mind softcore hits that cater to the male gaze like Species (1995) but I think it's an apt description, and Challengers shows us what this genre can be in the right hands. Finally, the score by Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Boys Noize is not only fantastic (as everyone is rightfully noting) but it is so integral to the mood and pacing of the film that it almost becomes another protagonist, especially in the genuinely riveting conclusion. That sequence may be one of the best uses of a score I've seen in a film in a very long time.I can't recommend this movie highly enough to anyone who enjoys movies. Please go see it!",

            "text": "I'm going to write this as a review for both Dune movies, so I'll include my thoughts about Dune part one throughout. For me, the most difficult part about rating these movies is trying to judge them as they stand on their own without comparing them to the original book.As movies, I think both are great: the cinematography is amazing, the sound design is good, the acting is good, I liked the visual style and how they interpreted the various technologies of the world of Dune. The soundtrack is good, it can be a little overbearing at times but the music in part two felt like an improvement on this from part one. One of the biggest complaints people had with both movies is the pacing, saying that the first movie was dragging and the second was rushing. I agree with the sentiments about the latter, but personally I enjoyed the slower pacing of the first Dune movie. The second movie definitely moves quickly through its first half, then it slows down a lot in the second half before rushing to its conclusion.The casting is good for the most part, I personally disagree with casting Rebecca Ferguson but I'll get into that more later. In the first movie I wasn't especially impressed with Timothée Chalamet as Paul but I think he does better in the role in the second part. Jason Momoa was a perfect pick for Duncan Idaho and Oscar Isaac did a great job as Duke Leto. Stellan Skarsgard was a good choice for Baron Harkonnen but I think he could have been written better. I was really looking forward to seeing Christopher Walken as the Emperor Shaddam but unfortunately he felt pretty lifeless and didn't bring very much energy to the scenes he was in.Overall, as they stand on their own, the Dune movies are great films. I don't know if I'd call them the defining sci-fi movies of the 21st century like other people are saying, but they're still very good, definitely rewatchable, and I would recommend them.Now, moving on to comparing them to the books, because once you start doing that you get to the more disappointing side of these movies. One of the biggest issues with both movies, especially the second, is that they almost completely leave out the ecological message of the book. This is a book that has been used as a textbook in environmental science classes, but I guess the filmmakers decided that message wasn't important enough. The Fremen are shown to be working towards terraforming Dune into a green world, slowly but surely making wind traps and planting grasses to fix the dunes in place. It's a goal that they are working towards with total commitment even though they know that it won't be realized for several generations. That's a powerful message that I think a lot more people need to hear nowadays, especially in reference to the issue of climate change. The movie barely mentions this goal at all, which I think is a disservice to the original story, and it diminishes the Fremen as characters.I think the fundamental issue that these movies have with their adaptations is an understandable one, but that it could've been solved in a better way. The main issue with adapting the book is that the characters are very difficult to relate to: most of them are superhumans who have insane abilities. For the movies, a lot of the main characters are altered to make them more relatable to the audience, which is an understandable change. For some characters, this greatly improves them from the book, such as Duncan Idaho and Duke Leto. For others, like Chani and Jessica, it reduces the strength of their characters, which I'll explain more later.Additionally, the book has a lot of complex concepts and story plots that it never stops to fully explain to the reader, you're just supposed to pick it up as you go along and reread it to understand, making it a little obtuse. Dune is very dialogue-heavy, with a lot of the action happening in the background or only described briefly. To remedy this, the movies remove some of the more complex topics and add more action scenes, which are exciting and well choreographed, but in the second movie they start feeling repetitive and redundant, and they overpower the more intricate plot points.While the first movie cleverly managed to insert a lot of exposition without feeling like it was constantly lore dumping, part two feels like it's more afraid to explain things than the first, possibly because of complaints that \"nothing happened\" in the first movie. The result of this is that the second movie is much more action-heavy, but it still wants to include the complex topics from the book, so what we get is a bunch of action sequences with scenes of political complexities strung in between them, but without the full explanations necessary to clarify them. It's easy to understand why people who haven't read the books would feel confused by this, the movie barely takes the time to explain what's happening before it's moving on to the next scene of Fremen blowing up spice haulers.Getting into direct comparisons to the book now, and starting with the first movie: my two biggest issues with the first movie was how they changed Jessica and how they dumbed down the mentats. Starting with mentats, they are a hugely important part of all of the Dune books; Thufir Hawat is essentially a main character in the first book, and Peter de Vries is a terrifying mastermind behind the Harkonnen plans. Part of what triggers Paul's first vision of the coming Jihad in his name is that his mother tells him he was trained as a mentat from birth without his knowledge. In the movie, the word mentat is never said once; Paul's mentat training isn't brought up; Thufir Hawat is just a guy who rolls his eyes back in his head, says something smart and then disappears at the halfway mark; and Peter de Vries dies of poisoning. How disappointing.But what I think is the worse change that they made from the book is how they changed Jessica's character. While the Dune books get much more feminist as they go on, the first book has very few female characters. However, Jessica makes for a very strong main character: she has complete control over her mind and body, and through her Bene Gesserit training she has almost superhuman strength, speed, and can control others with the Voice. Her internal monologue also shows that she's almost always two steps ahead of everyone except Paul. In the movies, Jessica feels much weaker. In the first movie she's almost always crying or on the verge of tears, which makes it a lot believable when she starts killing Harkonnens with her bear hands, and it makes the scene in the tent when Paul gets his vision (the only part of the book where Jessica openly grieves) much less powerful.Moving on to the second movie is where the changes get more disappointing. The movie begins with Paul, Jessica and the Fremen fighting the Harkonnens in some battle between the fight with Jamis and them getting to Sietch Tabr, which wasn't in the book and felt like it was added for the sake of starting with an action sequence. After the fight, Jessica throws up involuntarily --- again, as a Bene Gesserit she should have total control over her body and it doesn't make sense for her to do that, even though she's pregnant.Speaking of Jessica's child, Alia isn't really a character in this, at least not like she was in the book. I can understand this, I had no idea how they were going to handle having a toddler who walks and talks like an adult and kills a man, and they handled it by having Jessica not give birth during the movie. They also don't really explain how Alia is pre-born, which is a piece of information that people who didn't read the book could probably use.Once Paul and Jessica get to Sietch Tabr, things feel a lot different. The book describes the interiors of the Sietch as being covered with drapery, rugs, and cushions. There are classrooms, plastic factories, and workshops. The movie doesn't show this at all: the Sietch interior is all smooth, carved stone rather than natural rock walls, there's no textiles to be seen, and essentially only the water reservoir is shown. In general, the depiction of the Fremen in the movie is much worse than the book. The Fremen are a very tight-knit community where people understand each other's needs so well that they don't even need to communicate them out loud. When Jessica feels like she needs a coffee, a Fremen with coffee simply appears without her giving an order. In the movie the Fremen are three things: good at stabbing people, fanatic believers in Paul, or people who hate the Mahdi prophecy and don't believe in Paul. In the book, this dissenting faction against Paul isn't really present, and Chani definitely isn't part of it. I can understand that the filmmakers probably added it to help drive home the anti-hero worship message which a lot of people missed from the book, but it could have been executed better.I also disliked how they changed Chani. In the books she very easily falls for Paul and gives him unwavering support, and I think it's fine that they wanted to make that more nuanced for the movies, but I don't like the way they did it. The movie wants us to think that they love each other even though it constantly shows Chani ranting against the prophecy and disagreeing with Paul's actions. In the end, she leaves Paul after he agrees to marry the Emperor's daughter Irulan (even though in the book he makes it clear that he is only marrying her for politics, refuses to even touch her, and has three children with Chani instead). This ending will definitely complicate things if they do go through with adapting Dune Messiah to complete the film trilogy.I'm running out of room to write, and most people probably won't read this anyway because of the length, so I'll just say again that I enjoyed the movies and think they're good, but some of the changes they made, especially in part two, were disappointing and could have been executed better.",

            "text": "Had the pleasure to watch this film in an early screening and was completely blown away.\"Dune: Part 2\" is everything one could ask for from a film of its kind. As a big fan of the Game of Thrones franchise, it's been a long time since iv'e encountered this level of world-building and epicness. The plot and story development are carried out in an awe-inspiring manner throughout the movie, progressing at a precise pace toward a spectacular climax that is executed perfectly.Denis Villeneuve continues to prove himself as one of the most promising filmmakers of our time, and if it was up to me I would keep him in these high-budget epic tales such as these since there are very few directors working today that can tackle this genre as good as he does. The film received praise from many great filmmakers, the most notable being Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Oppenheimer), who very accurately compared Villeneuve's achievement in this film to the \"Empire Strikes Back\" of the modern era.Would highly recommend to re-watch the first movie in order to appreciate the subtleties and foreshadowing better, though it's not completely necessary since the movie is pretty self-contained. More specifically, one of the most prominent and impressive strengths of the movie is how it stands on its own without relying too heavily on the first part. Of course, for those who really want to enjoy the story, there's no real point in watching the second part without having seen the first one. However, even those who watched it a few years ago and don't remember every little plot detail will be able to catch up very quickly while watching the Pt. 2 and will understand all the important details-even the smaller ones. Non-ideally, even someone who hasn't watched the first movie at all will greatly enjoy this one, as it is very self-contained despite relying heavily on the first movie-an impressive and highly commendable screenplay effort by the writers.Timothée Chalamet delivers a very impressive and charismatic performance, to the point where it seems like this is the role he was born to play. Zendaya also gives a very good performance, with significantly more screen time than in the first movie. Austin Butler manages to be terrifying in the role of the villain, Rebecca Ferguson shines in one of the best performances of the year, and Javier Bardem surprises in a role that sometimes provides the comic relief of the movie. In addition to them, the film is filled with top-tier actors and actresses who all perform their roles amazingly.Hans Zimmer's score is masterful just as you'd expect, and one step up from the Oscar winning and Grammy nominated score of Pt. 1. Technical aspects such as VFX, Production Design, Sound, Editing, etc. Are all top notch and awards-worthy. The action sequences are absolutely mind blowing and sent chills down my spine. Denis direction is impeccable, and the story is absolutely fascinating- continuing to develop characters from Pt. 1 even deeper and introduce new incredible and intriguing characters.In my personal opinion, the movie is better than the first part in pretty much every aspect. While the first part was excellent, it mainly served as a setup and positioning of the pieces for the sequel. In \"Part 2,\" the story reaches its climax, with one of the strongest climaxes seen on the big screen in recent decades, befitting the complex work Frank Herbert wrote many years ago.I believe (and surely hope) this movie will be a major player in the next Award Season. Below-the-line wins are pretty much guaranteed as of now, but I hope it will get some love in above-the-line categories such as Direction and even Best Picture, perhaps to break stigmas presented against the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre in recent years at the Academy. As a big fan of the genre, unless a better competitor will be released later this eligibility period, maybe it's time for a movie like this to triumph once again.While the movie serves as a great wrap-up to the story introduced in Pt. 1, in my opinion it could serve as an even better set-up to a possible masterpiece in \"Dune: Messiah\", which I really hope will get green-lit soon.Don't miss the opportunity to catch this movie on IMAX, since I believe it's an historic piece of epic-Fantasy/Sci-Fi cinema and a movie that will be remembered as a classic of the genre.Extremely recommended.",

            "text": "Phenomenal stuff. I'll probably calm down tomorrow but right now my heart's beating like crazy and my brain's screaming it's a bloody masterpiece. This is one of the few movies that I didn't try to control my expectations beforehand and it still surpassed them in many ways.\"Power over spice is power over all\"- that kinda turned out to be a lie at the end. As The movie starts, I felt an immediate sense of tension through its score. It's a cinematic experience; I can't imagine feeling the same lying at home in bed, watching in headphones. The resonating vibrations as the sounds reverberate through the theater created an epic atmosphere.When Part One came out people said it was \"game of thrones in space\", I wasn't really taken by that as much, especially since people said the same about Apple TV's Foundation series. So I just enjoyed the movie as Dune and bore no comparisons. After watching part two however I see it; the world building, the politics, the epic grandeur of it all.However, the first half of Dune Part Two is pretty grounded and calm, delving into the lives of the Fremen. It almost feels like two distinct movies, the first half intricately setting the stage for the climactic third act and reinforcing character connections established in Dune Part One. Unlike the Part One's focus on lore, this movie is more devotion-driven, also resembling a political narrative, especially knowing of the hidden puppeteers behind the empire. The result appears to be an intricate web of schemes involving the empire, the witch-advisor women(can't spell their names lol), and the Baron's family. Despite the emperor's pulling the strings, the Baron's family still felt like main antagonist to me.The second half of the movie is where we see the epic scale of dune. The movies not quick paced but you couldn't tell, I was absolutely immersed in it.I absolutely loved the kind \"The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi.\" Theatre burst out in laughter. It felt weird, I wasn't expecting any humour. It's funnier than I expected. More lively than the first Dune movie. I'd already seen the Usul-worm-riding scene from the Dune Part One reopening bonus content. I was still just as excited and it didn't spoil a thing.The visual brilliance, as expected was stunning, elevating every aspect. The authenticity of the scenes made it feel as if characters were immersed in the environment, rather than merely placed against a green screen. I loved the portrayal of time passing through Paul's changing eyes; the longer he stays the bluer his eyes get. Despite how lively it is, the plot, while progressing at a measured pace, remains engaging, drawing attention away from its deliberate slowness. It has much more action, the battles were absolutely epic, I feel like they could have been longer but they still captivated me.Jessica disappears for a while, but just when I thought that, she showed up. Other than Paul and Zendeya, the rest of the cast doesn't really get as much screen time as you'd think. I loved the baby/embryo/featus scenes. Batista with no mask in the desert while his whole team's suited up was badass. I love him in darker roles, although I think some moments felt overly animated. But it gave an effective contrast to Austin Butler though, I couldn't wait to see what his character was like. Very fierce, intimidating and psycho. The girl shivering with the plate in her hands before the gladiator games made me chuckle. Butler did also sound like the baron at times.Dune: Part Two stands steady on its own, it felt complete compared to the more introductory feel of Part One. Despite this, I still felt like it lays groundwork for Dune: Part Three/Messiah, leaving a sense of setup. The movie, while feeling like a precursor, still manages to provide a more conclusive ending. I also think you should watch Part One first, if that has to be said; and the prospect of a back-to-back viewing sounds like a fun afternoon.One thing I can complain about is Stilger. I have mixed feelings. In Part One, Javier was fierce and was my favorite character, in this movie though he's depicted as a religious fanatic for the most part. It was done well, but I still miss the Stilgar who walked up to Duke Leto Atreides with no disregard. This felt like a different person, still fierce, just different.Loved Austin butler though, I wasn't sure what to expect as I tried my best to avoid trailers and teasers apart from the Dune part one bonus content. That short lady in charge of extracting 'the water of life' had some insane calves on her, I'm extremely jealous.While I was initially not convinced about Timothée Chalamet as the lead, he truly owns the role in the sequel, displayed acting facets I'd not seen before from him. The movie essentially unfolds as Paul Atreides' coming-of-age story, with Zendaya delivering an amazing performance. The first act, focusing on their love story, adds depth to the events at the movie's end. Zendaya's portrayal transcends the typical love story, I hope her role extends into Dune: Messiah, and hopefully adds further complexity to her character.We see Paul undergo some transformations. From being the son of royalty to experiencing love, the narrative takes a surprising turn when he assumes authority in the third act. Although I liked it, it felt a bit rushed. But, I found solace/logic with the \"water of life\" spiritual poison, where drinking it resulted in a profound shift in your personality. The contrast between the before and after versions of Paul, as well as Jessica, is striking so it kinda made sense to me.I think watching this movie at home won't do it justice, it's clearly made for the big screens if you can. It's pretty epic and I think it'll remain memorable as one of 2024's best movies, despite only being February. I absolutely loved it.",

So I hope it does well at the box office because I need Dune Messiah now. This is everything I love about going to the movies. Also, Hans Zimmer.For book readers, I'd say this one takes more liberties than the first, but they were changes I liked, some for the better even. For the most part, it still hits the main beats from the book with a few things altered. The biggest change being no time jump. Therefore, a certain character doesn't fully appear in the movie contrary to the book. Though, they still use the character in a different way that I liked personally.I know it's early in the year, but you can lock some Oscar nominations for this movie: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Score, Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume, Best Production Design, Best Makeup, and hopefully Rebecca Ferguson this time for Best Supporting Actress. I guess that's pretty much every category now that I've typed it out lol.",

            "rating": 8.0,
            "text": "As with the first film, the production was beautiful. I loved the opening scenes with the Harkonnen soldiers. The arena fight between Austin Butler and the last Atreides Robert Yuan (actors names) was fantastic. The battles with the harvesters were phenomenal.The script, however, left me a little bit disappointed. What about the Guild Navigators? And how were the worms used after they came through the pass in the mountains opened up by the atomics? There was only one sequence of the initial charge (marvelous sequence when the gunships entered) but then nothing. The Sardurkar were not given enough respect in this film. There was only one scene that showed them respect and that was when they rose up from the fallen sand and rock debris and stood their ground preparing for the oncoming onslaught instead of panicking. Other than that I felt the film should have spent more time on tactical combat scenes in what was supposed to be an epic battle at the end of the film, maybe trim time off of the other dragged out sequences in the film. The first movie did a better job with the Sardaukar, you actually feared them. The epic battle at the end of this movie was less than epic. And poor Bautista, they should not have made him act like such a wimp, should have had a more glorious fight even in retreat.As much as I like Walken, I thought he was poorly cast to be Emperor. The 1984 film had a perfect actor for the personality. This is Villeneuve's fault, he picked him.The script also fails to emphasize that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach at the end of the movie. Paul's initial ability to vaguely see the future comes from the centuries of genetic tinkering of the women of the Ben Gesserat, but after he drinks the water of life and not only survives but develops the ability to see an individual's past, as evident by the scenes in the Fremen temple where he looks at individuals and describes their past, and more clearly sees optional future outcomes, and after he actually fulfills all of the prophecies of the Fremen, the story is true, he really is the Messiah of Arrakis, justifying the religion, and he really is the Kwisatz Haderach, a man with abilities that no other man has. But the film appears to gloss over this. Shame. He is not just some populist charismatic man blamed by the likes of Zendaya's character for (perceived) fooling anyone to follow him and falling for the appeal of power and giving up his principles, he is more than that.My critique of the first film was not enough emotion, well part 2 does a better job, especially after Paul survives the water of life and becomes the anti-hero, all hell breaks loose. And Zendaya's character being a more independent women than the 1984 film was interesting, albeit the combat skills or luck were not realistic unless you buy that the Sardaukar were that inept. Part 1 was a better drama than part 2, but part 2 has some great action sequences, besides the disappointments I mentioned earlier. Not a perfect film for this Dune 1984 admirer.",

The emotional connection between Paul and Chani, so vital to the story, is completely lacking and unbelievable. The two main characters are good looking enough but has absolutely zero chemistry on screen.I am certain Zendaya is a fine actress in some things, but she has basically 2 facial expressions here, and the one she uses the most is a scowl directed at Paul. I found her to be the worst part of this movie.The final fight scene is short, choppy, and a mess. It felt anticlimactic and unfulfilling\nThe Harkonens are basically reduced to bumbling villainy almost cartoonish. The ending was super abrupt, and was so different from the book that it left me wondering what the filmmakers would do if they want to do a sequel.I want to reiterate that this isn't a bad movie. Villenue is great at creating a world that looks living and breathing, but he can't give life to individual characters.It is like he can't see the trees for the forest.",

I wasn't familiar with the story and I went with zero expectations, only to be completely stunned by the masterful artwork that was Dune Part 1.The music, the sound, the visuals, the entire world and its atmosphere, the characters even the plot, I found everything beautifully crafted and a breath of fresh air for the Sci-Fi genre.I am not familiar with the source material so this is considering only the movies and while I had a deep desire to love this second part specially considering the reviews it has been getting and how much I loved the first one, I couldn't help but feel a slight disappointment...\nLet's start with the positives - the cinematography is consistently out of this world, it is a visual wonder, a mix of practical effects with CGI that blends in perfectly. The intense and dramatic sound effects associated with a thrilling and daunting soundtrack delivers! And of course the acting is consistently good, this time around it was great to see Javier Barden's character being developed and bringing some great topics to the table.What makes me wonder the most to be honest is how different both the first movie and the second are being reviewed by the general public..\nFor once its running time is considerable (almost 3 hours) and somehow it feels strangely rushed... It's a bit odd to explain but in other words, we get so many scenes that feel that don't contribute at all to the narrative and out of the blue we transition to a scene where the main character changes the demeanor entirely without much build up leading to it..\nThe movie spends so much time trying to connect Paul to the Fremens, yet it fails to explore his own inner motivations, the moment we see his character changing, it gives you the feeling that you missed something.Paul's betrayal to Chani also feels a bit irrelevant since the chemistry built on the first movie seems to just dissipate...\nThe relationship with his mother is also very odd and inconsistent, her character becomes dark fairly early in the movie, in one moment she is her beloved mother and without much shared screen time he then seems to almost despise her by the end of the film without the audience having a deeper understanding of their relationship dynamic.The newly introduced villains are one dimensional and having Austin Butler's character seemed pointless... there was no goal for him, he gets killed off almost instantly alongside with the Baron who got so much build from the first movie...\nAn A list of actors like Florence Pugh, Christopher Walken and Léa Seydoux, all of them could've been amazing characters but get zero chance of showing that.An entire plot with Paul's sister goes out the drain as well... messing with time started to become promising but it leads nowhere... I mean I could go on, in short the movie had many plot gaps, didn't develop the characters properly, poorly introduced the newcomers and relied heavily on its outstanding cinematography and sound.It's a shame because I can't tell you how excited I was to write a praising review, but this was my honest opinion which apparently doesn't seem to align with the majority.A lot of scenes drag without much substance to it, the highlight of the film was Javier Barden's character and the messages behind the dangerous of the concept of a Messia.I am of course hopeful for the third movie, maybe with my expectations now lowered it becomes a great experience all over again.",

            "text": "It was a visual spectacle and refreshingly it lived up to and beyond the hype.However, for me there was a niggling itch through the movie. Something about Chani's character that bothered me and only grew as the movie progressed.I googled to see if others shared this feeling, all I could find was praise for the character. However there was consensus that she was written very different from the book.I finally found an article that helped describe the disconnect I felt with ChaniThe following is not my writing and all credit is given to Kara Kennedy - \" ...Herbert's novel Dune, Chani has a range of roles and avenues of strength, influence, and power. She becomes Paul's love but begins as the young woman who introduces him to a foreign desert land in his visions and the one who guides him as he integrates into the Fremen community. She is a fierce young fighter as well as a religious leader in her role as Sayyadina, standing apart from Paul to oversee the cultural rites. She is a young mother who finally wins the approval of her child's Bene Gesserit grandmother, Jessica, and saves Paul from a long coma. She is wise enough to understand the political necessities of Paul legally marrying a princess and trusted by him to negotiate the marriage contract.Chani's attachment to Paul is an important part of the story, but it does not reduce her to being a simple, one-dimensional female character. Chani is an essential window into Fremen culture. Her multi-faceted character challenges stereotypes about women of faith and women in non-Western cultures that continue to be debated about in the real world.Meanwhile, the films-Dune: Part One and especially Dune: Part Two-make substantial changes to Chani's character in the name of making her more independent, which end up making her more stereotypically masculine. She is mainly a fighter who has a fling with Paul. She is not a mother and not a religious figure, instead rejecting any association with religious beliefs or practices. She is almost a second Jamis except that she has a brief romantic entanglement with Paul.Chani's disavowal of the religious elements in her culture arguably represents a contemporary, Western, cynical view taking over the story; that religion must be purged to empower the individual, to free women from their shackles. This change in Chani's character appears to be intended to make her more free and complex, because she's not a follower and she doesn't believe. She can be dismissive of Paul and sees little to learn from him. Their relationship is then not a mutual exchange, a partnership, but something she has to turn aside from to be independent.The underlying message is that if Chani were a woman of faith like in the book, she couldn't be an interesting, complex character, just a follower who's oppressed. The takeaway is that the Fremen's religious system is bad because it was influenced by outsiders. That faith makes people weak and that being a fighter and killer is preferable to being like the women who live in the sietches, wear headscarves, and discuss religious ideas, or who carry the tribe's ancestors in their bodies.Chani may also reflect a deeper fear in the increasingly secular West about the power of religion in the 21st century. It is possible that the idea in Dune of an oppressed group militarily united under a religious banner, drawing strength from a belief in something greater than themselves, is still too much to put on screen in an adaptation, especially given the book's Middle Eastern influences. If viewers need to be reassured that not everyone believes, that there is division, that someone is the rational one to turn away from the 'fundamentalists,' then Chani offers this. She is the contrasting perspective, the voice of so-called reason, who questions the religious indoctrination.But ultimately, the considerable changes made to Chani's character for Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations alienate her from her lover and her culture and strip her of the many roles she has in the book. Any complexity gained by her skepticism is offset by the loss of her influence and authority and her place in her community. Chani's depiction in the films worryingly suggests that the price of being an independent woman means being faithless and alone.\"",

            "text": "\"Dune\" has been successfully put to the big screen. Not only is this a good adaptation, it passes with flying colors.The character arc of Paul Atreides is fascinating and complex. I love how they delved into his psyche and motivations so prevalently in this movie. He is reluctant to take up the Messianic mantle because he knows it's a lie. But things go according to his vision and he becomes a morally complex character. Religious fantacism takes hold of the fremen.It is up for interpretation what kind of character Paul becomes. Is he a tyrant? Was it the only path? What does religion have to do with it? Paul takes hold of the Bene Gesserit lie by exploiting faith.This leads to other questions. Can one truly trust the arm of flesh? The frailty of man? Leaders have come and gone throughout history bringing different ideals.One's own morality comes into play. Agency is vital to the human experience. Man will always falter. This leads to questions of a higher power and His role. Is there a God above? What are the implications of that?We don't get stories like this in Hollywood anymore. There is no happy ending in Dune, and one can only ponder the moral complexities of it. The book and movie have made me contemplate many things and I deeply appreciate stories like that.Others have already applauded the effects, acting and script, so I won't go into that too much here. What I will say is it was the best looking movie I have ever seen. Everything looked lived in. The fight scenes were choreographed masterfully. Each actor gave outstanding performances. Hans Zimmer gives a mesmerizing soundtrack.Frank Herbert's vision was honored masterfully. Well done Denis Villeneuve.",

Aside from Walken as Emperor, which in my opinion was not a great cast. Nothing against Christopher as an actor, but he just doesn't seem all that well in that roll, but still good enough to get the job done. Also, I am not the biggest fan of Zendaya. Visually she's a good cast for Chani, but her constant angry face and little chemistry with Paul is distracting. Chalamet and Ferguson absolutely nailed the roles.My main issues with the movie are incomplete or reduxed storytelling and that the director decided not to include possiblly some of the most important and fascinating elements and scenes, at least for me, from the story.The werding way. I was disappointed, since the technology was available, that the directoror did not incorporate the (Bene Gesserit) werding way martial art of Paul and Jessica, where the moments were so fast that it almost appeared as teleportation. This should have been in the movie, to emphasize how incredibly skilled, mysterious and god-like Paul and Jessica would be to the fremen (and the viewer).Jessica's reverend mother transformation was not explained properly and seriously underperformed by the writing. The explanation of the magnitude and significance of what Reverend Mother is was not construed properly in the movie. Reverend mothers were seriously overpowered beings with strong powers and influence. The fact that there was another hidden reverend mother on Dune was not signified properly. The transformation in the book was much more poignant and there was very little explanation to Jessica's daughter Aliah, and the Abomination. Jessica's role was seriously deminished in the second movie.Kwisatz Haderach, I found the significance and explaition and the powers were inadequately explained and explored by the movie. As mentioned earlier, the significance of powers of Reverend Mothers. But it wasn't shown how much of a big deal the Kwisatz Haderach actually was and how much more powerful he was. His precience, past memories should have been more visually and nuanced.It felt like the director was too cautious or afraid to explore the more mysterious and transcedental parts of the story, which in my opinion are the core of the story. Without it feels almost pointless and like a different plot, where Paul just fights to free the Fremen and Jessica gets a nun spiritual job with the Fremen. While Paul is shown as a gifted fighter with some sort of special abilities, that don't look all that different to anyone else. Where in fact Paul's fighting when using weirding way would almost be incompreheble to the Fremen.In summary, the movie is a visual feast with a theatrical presence of a masterpiece, but fails capture the magnitude of the main characters and their abilities and in essence what the power struggle (not just for spice) is all about. Could have been a 10/10.",

Gone are the days when actors were given roles based on talent and could actually talk in a normal clear tone, like George Clooney.Overall the movie itself looks amazing and helps people overlook the boring as crap first 2 hours. All the high ratings and reviews on here are fans of the book and fans of visuals but clearly don't go to movies to be entertained. Between the acting of Zendaya, Dave Bautista, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh this movie should pick up a few razzie awards for bad acting, assuming people realise an empty blank look on your face does not involve any acting.It's time critics and social media reviewers took their heads out of their lower back region and stopped blowing up average movies in an attempt to turn them into classics that they clearly are not.",

The supposed \"best scenes\" seemed to blur together in a haze of monotony, leaving me searching for a standout moment or two to cling to.While I can appreciate the efforts of the filmmakers and the ambition behind bringing such a beloved story to life, I can't help but feel that the overwhelming hype surrounding this adaptation is somewhat unwarranted. Despite its visual spectacle and star-studded cast, Dune 2 left me yearning for a deeper connection and a stronger emotional resonance that simply wasn't present.In the end, while the film may find its audience among die-hard fans of the franchise or those with a particular affinity for its themes, for me, it fell short of the lofty expectations set by its predecessors and failed to leave a lasting impression.",

The colors are vivid, the lighting is gorgeous and the cgi is mostly indistinguishable from reality.That said, despite being almost 3 hours long, the story felt hugely condensed. It felt like each scene gives you the bare minimum to understand what's happening, but elaborates on nothing. It felt like it wants you to immerse yourself in a unique and complex world, but gives every setting only a few minutes of time before hopping straight to the next. For example, the training of Paul. We never see him learn how to ride the sandworm, so when he succeeds, it doesn't feel as triumphant as it would have otherwise. The Harkonnens are also much less intimidating than they were before. Most of their screentime is comprised of them trying and failing to farm spice on Arrakis, until they are defeated by Paul and the Fremen at the end without much difficulty. They should have put up more of a fight. Lastly, I know from sources that an ecological message the was very important in the book was emmited completely from the film. The Fremen speak of bringing green back to Arrakis, but that's all we ever see them do.Part of it may be a limitation of the format. If one must adapt a book full of complex lore, than either a trilogy or even a serialization may be the better option as you get more time to explain everything. I know that a third film is coming but it's not based on the same book anymore, and while I haven't read any of the books, I don't believe I should. I believe that film should stand on its own two feet, and this one does. Its legs are long and slender, with just the bare minimum of muscle required to stand, but it stands nonethelss :)",

Dawn is especially a masterpiece of intelligent sci-fi adventure spectacle, a movie that is both exciting and intelligent. The entire trilogy is emotionally engaging and Caesar is an incredible lead.Unfortunately, this film doesn't have any characters as good as Caesar. In fact, it feels like a lesser retread of the same ideas and themes of the previous trilogy. There's nothing really new here. You've already seen a better version of this movie before.With that said, let me get the good out of the way first. The cinematography is excellent. The visual effects are still incredible, both as a technical and artistic achievement. The first 45 minutes of the film are really solid. There's a lot of good visual storytelling in the opening act.However, once we meet the main antagonist, things kinda fall apart. The pacing is off. Some scenes drag, while major character moments feel rushed. There's a friction between two major characters that doesn't feel earned, especially since the characters kinda come to an understanding, and then a few scenes later they are butting heads. What could and should have been an interesting dynamic feels incomplete, like entire scenes were cut out.The main antagonist could have been really cool. The idea of a cult-like warlord obsessed with human history, there's so much they could have done with that idea. But he simply doesn't have enough scenes to really make him anything more than Koba Part II. And Koba had better motivations and more complexity. None of the characters here are as well written as the previous trilogy and the last 10 minutes feel more like a TV finale than a movie.Oh, and the music score is pretty generic and forgettable. Really disappointing, because I love the music from the other movies. Caesar's theme is so good. Nothing here comes close.Anyway... Kingdom is far from terrible, but to quote another major franchise with a movie coming out May 2024: \"Mediocre!\"",

It's bland, and often just feels like we're watching scenes checking off boxes from an adventure story. Like a movie coming out of an assembly line. Character motivations are unclear, the mc's emotional arc is unclear, and overall every idea just doesn't feel fleshed out, even when they almost have a good one. How Caesar's legacy is handled in this movie is almost interesting, but again it is not fleshed out. I will say the movie starts strong, I didn't really start turning on it til I realized how bored I was about halfway through. And that's before the third act really just frustrated me.

Caeser strives incrediblely hard to find his oasis, and yet it gets destroyed within the first 15 minutes of the film, in about 5 minutes? It effectively retconned the last film, Caeser's sacrifice was for nothing.The ending is quite good.

It is set in what would be their \"Bronze Age\" where all the simian populations are living in clans and the concepts, teachings and philosophies of the original intelligent Ape, Caesar, is more myth than reality.Enter our hero, NOA (wonderfully played in motion capture by Owen Teague - the bully Patrick Hockstetter in the IT films) who is leaving a peaceful life with his family and his clan. Their clan of chimpanzees is overpowered - and thrown into slavery - by a clan of Gorillas led by Proxima Caeser (Kevin Durand - Little John in the Russel Crowe ROBIN HOOD film of 2010) - also ably rendered in motion capture. This sets Noa on a journey to rescue his clan aided by an Orangutan, Rata (Peter Macon - Bortus in the t.v. Series THE ORVILLE) and...gasp...a HUMAN (Freya Allan - THE WITCHER).It is this journey by this disparate trio that brings the emotional power to this film as the trio must decide to try to trust each other while also coming to grips with what their world has become.It's an interesting allegory that is subtle and does not try to preach or hit the audience over the head and the 3 actors (despite 2 of them being rendered in motion capture) form a compelling trio to watch.And...that is because this film is wrapped in an action/adventure CGI story that is a marvel to view. The motion-capture of the actors is superb - this technology has come a long way since Tom Hanks in THE POLAR EXPRESS and one forgets that one is looking at a rendering and not a real, flesh and blood actor - even if that actor is an ape.Director Wes Ball (the MAZE RUNNER films) does a very strong job of keeping the plot moving and the characters grounded while also dazzling with marvelous special effects and battle scenes that are well choreographed (you know where all the major players are and what their motivations are during the action). This helps to bring a very enjoyable summer blockbuster film to the cineplex - and you don't even need to have viewed any of the previous Planet of the Apes films to understand what's going on.A very pleasant surprise and I look forward to the next (11th) feature in this series.Letter Grade A-8 (out of 10) StarsAnd...you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",

Therefore, he needs to go and collect another egg before said ceremony. While he is out, he runs into a band of apes hurting other apes and they track him back to his village, which they decimate and bring Noa's clan into servitude. Noa escapes and seeks out his family and comes across an orangutan named Raka, and they both encounter a human woman who, it turns out, can talk. They are captured and brought to the palace of Proximus Caesar, an evil gorilla who desires to have all apes under his kingdom.While there are many, many nods to the original 1968 film (including musical cues) and the movie had very stunning visual effects, the story itself was kind of lethargic when it wasn't in set piece mode.The acting - with a couple of exceptions - was just okay and this is an indication that future movies need a protagonist that meets the stature of Andy Serkis and Roddy McDowell. Owen Teague as Noa, is barely adequate and the same can be said for Freya Allen as Mae, the talking human. She obviously has ulterior motives, but her performance doesn't. The only three actors in the film that are worth mentioning are Peter Macon as Raka, the orangutan, whose motion capture seems to show his jovial good nature and charm, William H. Macy (yeah! That guy!!!) as a human who educates Proximus Caesar on human history and literature and who radiates the word \"collaborator\" and finally the great character actor Kevin Durand, as big bad Proximus himself. Durand, as he always does, radiates menace.There's no reason that this story could not have been accomplished in less than 145 minutes and it just seems that nowadays the name of the game is to make movies longer for the sake of making movies longer. This movie really dragged, not because of any poor story choices (because the story itself was decent), but because of poor choices in the editing room.I see where this movie trilogy is going and it's fine but is the next motion picture going to be two hours and 45 minutes long and the final movie in this trilogy going to be three hours long? These are Planet of the Apes movies - we're not the defining Pi.

            "text": "This movie is just about a worthy successor to the original set of movies from the 20th century.Like them, it uses state of the art special effects to wittily investigate contemporary questions of ethics, humanity, status and prejudice while distracting the popcorn crowd with an engrossing adventure of exploration, captivity and escape in a make-believe world that, in what is a strong science fiction tradition, is recognisably a few \"what if?\"'s away from our own.Unlike the original five movies, where each sequel was originally unplanned, this is clearly a new \"chapter one\", taking the time to introduce some elements that will feature in the upcoming sequels.Over and over it evokes the sense of wonder of the original handful, with plenty of specific visual, musical and thematic evocations. There are reognisable influences from the 1970s TV show and even some of the Apes comic book stories of that era. But, it is also unmistakably a post-Lord of the Rings epic, the influence showing up in how various action and travel sequences have been shot.While there is not nearly so much sly humour as the originals, the socio-historic themes are more nuanced, closer to the surface and harder to miss. Questions of defining civilisation in terms of laws are answered in a way that will ultimately resonate with modern audiences; a layered and varied spectrum of responses to enslavement is shown; and as expected, anti-monarchist revolutions will always play well in the USA.Non-Americans may roll their eyes a little at the very earnest equating of eagles with capital-L Liberty (one can't imagine Charlton Heston's sardonic and cynical George Taylor from the 1968 movie being very impressed), but on the plus side, Peter Macon's wonderful Raka just about matches the delightful charm of Kim Hunter's Zira and Roddy McDowell's Cornelius from the originals. Owen Teague also does a good job as Noa.The various fight scenes are competent without being overly thrilling (the most exciting action is a cornfield chase vaguely inspired by the original 1968 film), but the deeper probing into the various sub-texts and a fine selection of minor characters keeps the interest levels up. One could pick nits about some of the physics shown in the last twenty minutes, but it's hardly the first Hollywood film to sacrifice strict logic for spectacle and it surely won't be the last.Overall, this does a good job of working on several levels and should appeal to a good range of audiences.",

I really liked how the franchise once again showcases the humanity of the apes, like the touching funeral scene. It had breathtaking scenery throughout, especially the transformation of metropolitan cities into forests. I found it interesting how they introduced pets, a bird is an ape's best friend, essentially. I liked that we exploring their customs in the first act of the movie.While the film's length and the extensive world-building sometimes made it feel a bit slow, every scene served a purpose in the end, especially considering this's setting the stage for a new era in the Planet of the Apes movies. We get to see how the environment, the apes and the humans have evolved. I liked how the movie paid homage to Caesar without directly continuing his story; his legacy felt respectfully acknowledged. He had a good run and his story was complete.The premise of the movie, particularly the portrayal of the antagonists, reminded me of religious wars, where the apes resemble Christian crusaders using a historic figure's image to justify war and violence, a theme with deep implications. The movie addresses that but not in a way that will make you leave the theatre pondering. How teachings can be misconstrued.This installment's message felt more overt compared to the trilogy, almost as if the apes were portrayed as essentially human. The trilogy was always telling a human story through apes, it was always obvious but now the fourth installment is quite on the nose.Good time is spent with the characters, so when moments of sadness or goodbyes arise, we feel it too. It's slow paced but I was heavily invested. The scene where she calls out to Noah was amazing. Hearing an 'echo' speaking, was almost as shocking when Caesar screamed \"go!\" for the first time. Also was she essentially looking for an English textbook? Lol.While Noah is the lead character, there were instances where Mae took the forefront, causing some confusion about the movie's primary focus. She didn't feel explored or interesting enough but I loved Freya Allan's performance.It's a drama. It's not what I was expecting, I thought it'd me more action packed, but it's still good. It was different to my expectations the way \"War for the Planet of the apes\" also wasn't a full blown war as well. I also think this is the first movie since the trilogy started where earth was now actually a planet of apes. Humans clearly have been dominated.Following up on Caesar was always gonna be difficult, I think he was a beloved character and we got to see his whole journey. The new lead character Noah is alright, however, I didn't find myself super captivated by him. We got to see Caesar's full character arc, birth to death; while Noah is already a little older, coming-of-age age. His story is still interesting though.The conflict of ideas between Noah and Mae could have been more intense. There were times when I thought \"ouu this is about to be a big fight/argument\" and it's just meh. It wasn't as thought provoking as I would've liked. I liked Proximus Caesar though, I thought he made quite the enticing antagonist. Second most interesting character after Raka*.The ending hints at the possibility of another trilogy, laying a solid foundation for future installments. Overall, I liked it more than \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" but not as much as the sequels. \"Dawn of the planet of the apes\" is still my favorite. It's not as epic as I thought it'd be; I think it's more enjoyable if you're already into the franchise. It doesn't do anything terribly, I just didn't walk out of the theatre thinking \"wow!\" People were applauding a lot throughout the movie actually. There was a guy who sat close to me and blacked out before the movie started, snoring the entire time. Thought about not waking him up after the movie finished because everyone literally just walked by him. This dude bought imax tickets, large bucket of popcorn, large soda and some more snacks, all that just to sleep before the movie started. Anyway, I still enjoyed the whole thing, and very much looking forward to whatever's next.Also just found out it's directed by they who did maze runner movies and they actually both have such similar aura to them.",

While I liked the trilogy, I didn't think they had been quite the blockbusters to spawn another trilogy, and they had a sombre tone. Nevertheless intrigued, I went for the early screening not having even watched a trailer or read anything about it.First off, watch it on whichever premium format you can. The CGI is really well done from apes emoting to the dramatic terrains.I liked that the hero was a little diffident at first but grew with the story. Sure we've seen it a thousand times, but it was still an identifiable journey.The ideology splits were shown well, the action sequences were effective and the shades of characters kept me interested. Sure it left a few questions hanging, but I guess those are for the sequel(s).Pacing did feel slow at times but I like that personally better than nonstop effects and explosions. Mae was the more intriguing character, with Noa's arc (see what I did there) being a more predictable one. If you let yourself go on the journey, I think you'll enjoy it. No huge surprises in the story though - you'll know if you're gonna like it or not pretty much in the first act. Have fun!",

The flick loses a star because of its lack of perception. It is narcissistic in a way as the team had difficulty displaying perception or the emotion of belief behind each tribes following.

And somehow most of the film consists of the most uninteresting world exploration and character development.

The world looks wonderful and leaves the viewer to ponder where the adventure is now. CGI was well done, but as the Achilles' heel of modern movies, it was also overused. I would still be happy with a gorilla or monkey mask with traditional practical effects. The story moved forward but got off to a slow start.

            "text": "Fight Club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it. The nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life. From the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraying how consumerism moves the world, but is unable to give relief in the end. Flipping through catalogues of new furniture for his apartment is the narrator's only personality trait. To fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups. By lying to people, pretending he has conditions he does not have, the narrator finds relief - the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night. The emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic. David Fincher makes a subtle, yet clear, comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other. The system doesn't care about anyone, the distance between people - especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world - is a major plot point. However, when the narrator is finds someone who's a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape - \" Her lie reflected my lie. Suddenly, I felt nothing. I couldn't cry, so once again I couldn't sleep\".Shortly after Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is introduced into the story, the main character loses everything he valued. Deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is. If the narrator is a worker who's way too worried about his condo and his job, Tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldn't care less about all those things. The contrast between them is clear; Tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading - \"Right. We are consumers. We're the by-products of a lifestyle obsession.\" The characters portrayed here are so different because one of them is free, while the other is not. Tyler, in a nihilistic way, helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough - something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world - that all they can do is giving up everything. The self-destruction promoted by the Fight Club is ironically what allows the narrator - as well as many other frustrated men - to find solace in their mundane life. Little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job, about behavior and the value of things. It's interesting to note that the narrator doesn't quit his job immediately, picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system - he eventually does though.Many subtopics are discussed through the movie. We see the narrator and Tyler, now living together, talking about many things. They talk about how both had an absent father, how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense - \"He says, 'get a job'. So, I'm 25, I call again and say, 'now what?' He says, 'I dunno. Get married\". The nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment we're born, while both of them agree on that, they also agree that this is all a great waste of time. It's important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people, especially with women as Tyler comments - \"We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need\".As the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life - \"Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s**t we don't need\". Tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club; everyone is much more like the narrator, but they're striving to be more like him. At some point, Tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger - what he would call Project Mayhem. While the original Fight Club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom, through self-destruction, to its members, Project Mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system. The frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camel's back - \"We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pi**ed off\". However, the narrator starts to slowly go against what Tyler was meaning to do - kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society - and when this happen it's the moment the movie reaches its climax.The genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that Tyler Durden and the narrator are the same person, they have always been the same person. Due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life, he created an alter-ego - someone capable of manifesting everything he wasn't as a system abiding person. The contrast created by Tyler's different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds; and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about Tyler Durden is even more marvelous. This movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence - when you become just a number, just a braindead member of society, having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored. In the end Tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions can't be reverted - so he only stands by and watches. The final scene is beautiful; what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while \"Where is my Mind\" plays? This movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is - in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden. It is provocative, funny and thrilling and most importantly: It is so damn real. The plot aged perfectly and I don't think it is going to get old so soon - this movie is a must watch.",

I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends. 10 out of 10.",

The movie plays out, with a few key alterations, as a scene-by-scene retelling of the book, sometimes going so far as to lift paragraphs of inner monologue directly from the novel and plopping them into the script.It's a movie that requires at least two viewings but, beyond that, it gets boring in a pretty big hurry. Particularly toward the end of the second act/beginning of the third, it's so painfully bland and boring that it's difficult to care about anything that's happening at all (around the whole Project Mayhem stuff). It's difficult to maintain any kind of focus throughout.There's a lot of stuff hidden in this movie for people to go back and revisit, too, but most of it is inessential. Honestly, having looked back at some of the Easter eggs, it leaves the question: who cares? And of course this is an unpopular opinion to have, but I held off on reviewing this title in the honest hopes that multiple viewings would raise the rating. I even read Palahniuk's novel to try to derive some additional meaning out of it.Without giving away the ending, it makes you think, and it creates a nice gimmick to get people to watch it again but, as I said, beyond that I'm perfectly happy to close the chapter on this one and leave it in the past.The first rule of fight club is that you don't talk about fight club.

            "text": "Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been \"asked\" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves \"Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not.\" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: \"I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming.\" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club.

This is a complex, intelligent film which, for a change, doesn't take the viewer for granted. A big streak of black comedy runs through the centre, making things a bit easier to cope with, but it's still a morose, disturbing film, a good film, yes, but not one which makes you feel good after watching it.The plot twists and turns continually, from beginning to end. Things start off on a relatively small scale to become outrageous and explosive at the film's finale. There's also one of those very-clever twists at the end, so favoured by the likes of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. There is plenty of sick humour, the highlight being the hilarious scene involving the liposuction fat - you'll know it when you see it.With a film like this, the acting has to be brilliant, and it frequently is. Edward Norton excels as the narrator of the story, caught up in all the madness, and it's a multi-faceted, psychologically-focused performance. Brad Pitt doesn't really stretch himself but he fits the bill well and isn't afraid to put off his female fans by appearing broken and bloodied in a film like this. Other actors, ranging from Meat Loaf to Jared Leto, are also very good.The violence is extremely brutal and unglamourised. Heads are knocked hard against concrete, acid is poured over flesh, teeth are knocked out, and noses are split open. This is a hard film to watch, but fascinating at the same time. Fiendishly clever and highly suspenseful, I would rate FIGHT CLUB as one of the best films of 1999 - on par with THE SIXTH SENSE, and just under my favourite, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Buy it, rent it, steal it, but be prepared: you won't be the same afterwards.",

Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man. David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen. This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the nearest videostore! 5/5",

            "text": "\"Fight Club\" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the \"Choose life,\" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of \"Trainspotting,\" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of \"Seven\" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of \"The Game\" and assembled his strongest effort to date. \"Fight Club\" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes \"Fight Club\" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? \"Fight Club\" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with \"Kalifornia\" and \"Twelve Monkeys\", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the \"Legends of the Fall\" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what \"Fight Club\" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, \"win.\" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes \"Fight Club\" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.",

One of the reasons for that is the lack of variety and emotion Glen Powell puts in (or doesn't) in his performance. There should be a duality between his build-up cocky Ron hit man persona and Gary, his softer, nerdier, normal day-to-day self. Yet, when he supposedly switches between one and the other there's no real substantial difference between the two besides a cosmetic one. One would think this would be the role to show his acting prowess but there seems to be very little and this is nowhere near Bryan Cranston's duality performance skills as Walter White in Breaking Bad if we were to compare an actors task of switching between two sides of a character.There's never any palpable tension in Gary/Ron, he's always in control. He's in control when he becomes the face of the supposed hit-man for the first time (no nervousness, nothing), he is in control when everything starts to unravel, he's in control when he's being confronted with his actions during the climax of the film, and so on - and the film suffers very much from it as we never go along with the main character or actually worry about him, as the main actor never really does anything with it.Likewise, it's a bit boring at times, the cinematography is beyond plain and it's very predictable. The film would have been so much better had it been more stylised, with a more substantial visual flair and a cool soundtrack at least to cover its flaws, since overall there's not really much meat to the story and the film ends up being about nothing.",

His latest is HIT MAN, which is a romantic comedy that's very loosely based on an article about a real guy, Gary Johnson. Gary (Glen Powell) is a college professor and part-time staffer at the New Orleans Police Department. He stumbles into a new role as an undercover hitman, arresting people who try hiring him to kill someone. It turns out he's very good at it. Powell really showcases his talents here, playing different characters for each arrest. When he meets Madison (Adria Arjona) though, he breaks protocol. I guess Powell has great chemistry with whoever he works with. He has an undeniable charm that seems like it spreads to the whole cast. I could tell they had fun filming this. It also has a very smart script, playing with ideas of identity and being your true self. The strong sense of humour actually changes as the movie progresses, which was fun for me, but might not work for some. I find it hilarious that they must've asked the real Gary Johnson for permission to go as far as they do here. The movie makes it clear what actually happened during the end credits. HIT MAN is quirky, unconventional, and very enjoyable. If you can't see it in theaters, don't worry! It'll be on Netflix June 7th. Make sure the algorithm doesn't bury it. Enjoy!",

Linklater's latest lovingly pays homage to film noir, screwball comedy, Hitchcockian black comedy and even the good old psychosexual drama but it still somehow manages to conjure up a fresh, witty and often uproarious confection that frequently teases, delights and occasionally thrills the audience with frissons of excitement, keeping them enraptured all the way to its deliciously razor sharp ending.This is potentially a star-making turn for Glen Powell. Although he made a strong impression in Top Gun: Maverick as a cocky rival pilot, his role in Hit Man is easily more complex and, as the co-writer of the script, he has been able to add brilliant layers to his character, or should that be characters? In effect, Powell is playing more than one character - Gary Johnson, mild-mannered, cat-loving geeky Psychology professor and audio techie who moonlights as a surveillance expert for a Louisana-based police unit that targets and stings hapless ne'er-do-wells who are looking to hire a killer. Before the next sting operation, Gary's police colleague Jasper (Austin Amelio) who normally pretends to be the hired killer is suspended for brutally attacking two youths, which forces Gary's colleagues (brilliantly played by Retta and Sanjay Rao) into convincing Gary to take over from the universally loathed Jasper, much to Gary's dismay. Yet, within minutes of taking on the task, Gary suddenly morphs into \"Ron\" and during his first sting he is so convincing that his colleagues are shocked, even though they had believed he could do it having heard Jasper go through the rigamarole on previous occasions. It is a brilliant piece of acting.Having created the killer persona, Gary soon finds himself becoming more and more immersed in Ron, adding further, chameleon-like layers of disguise and character traits to mirror whoever is about to be stung. However, things become really complicated (in true film noir style) when \"Ron\" is approached by a femme fatale, Maddy (beautifully played by Adria Ajrona who also adds a delightfully a kooky sexy edge as well as a tender vulnerability). As the sparks between the two begin to fly during a hilarious but flirty exchange, Gary, who is clearly enjoying himself as Ron, finds himself conflicted. Dare he. As Ron, continue with the sting and have Maddy arrested for plotting to murder her husband? Has the flirtatious exchange caused Maddy to betray some regrets about what she is doing? The chemistry between Powell and Arjona is a pleasure to witness. Both actors bring out the best in one another and it is thrilling.Off-beat is an expression that would certainly apply to Hit Man - and it is a compliment. It is also one of the most enjoyable and fun 2 hours I've had in the cinema in the past few years. I absolutely adore this film.",

There is no doubt that Hit Man is a fun, maybe even entertaining, film at times. Seeing the magnificent Glenn Powell navigate the different personas he create for himself with considerable ease and suaveness is a great joy. But while this undercover average Joe turned hit-man idea may serve as an interesting premise, the film does not develop much from this premise meaningfully. The plot is overly slight, and the direction it goes is bizarre, especially the ending, which felt rushed and contrived. The plot does not develop in a manner which extracts full potential of comedy from its situation, and neither is it particularly entertaining. Also, Despite what some critics have praised, I could not see much chemistry between Arjona and Powell. Sure, they are both more than serviceable in their roles, and they share several steamy scenes, but there is no special spark or unique connection between the two. At the end of the day, I find Hit Man very similar to The Fall Guy, a movie released at around the same time. Both are serviceable, fun, and entertaining distractions which can barely hold and audiences attention for two hours. But both are overly light on actual plot, are only mildly entertaining, and not as funny or enjoyable as they should have been.",

We as a viewer saw no romantic or loving conversations in which they got to know each other better and I suppose that's part of the story with Gary being a supposed hitman and all, but it just makes the eventual romance seem sudden and odd.She then decides to drug a cop(!) in her own house(!!), Gary's just okay with it, finishes the job and it just fades into another sex scene and then fast forwards to where they have a happy family.

The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film.

            "text": "The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all. 10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru",

One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be \"entertained\". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.Overall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "text": "If you're unlucky to be born into a socially, economically and racially isolated community that has poverty, crime, drugs and violence as its everyday realities, the odds are stacked incredibly high against you. It literally takes so much effort, strength, struggle and plain ol' good fortune to simply avoid becoming a gangster, let alone do anything more with life. Most who find themselves in the situation described above never even enter this fight and out of those that do - only the rare ones succeed.\"City of God\" depicts this conundrum masterfully. In a Rio slum called Cidade de Deus we meet character after character that has the right idea, knowledge and courage to get out but somehow always ends up being pulled right back into this vicious circle. Becoming a hoodlum in Cidade de Deus isn't just a fringe career option for disenchanted rebels and social outcasts - it's the main industry.The images of gun toting pre-teen killers are very disturbing and Meirelles uses them relentlessly to underscore just how hopeless and frighteningly predetermined life is for these kids. Many of them can't read or write but already know how to use a gun and kill without remorse. In a particularly harrowing scene, local drug lord Ze Pequeno or Lil' Ze (Leandro Firmino da Hora) exacts revenge on a disobedient gang of 9 and 10 year olds by incapacitating two of them and forcing one of his own kid soldiers, as initiation of sorts, to choose which one of the two he wants to kill. Faced with death, one of the kids starts crying crocodile tears; suddenly all the bravado is gone and he is shown for what he truly is - a desperately misdirected infant.'If only these people had more options....' is the sentiment reinforced with every gruesome event. Of course, this lifestyle comes a little more naturally to some than to others. Ze Pequeno, for example, from an early age when he was known as Dadinho / Lil' Dice shows a considerable lack of aversion to blood and death. In another aptly choreographed scene so that we don't know what exactly happened until much later, he more than 'holds his own' alongside much older gangsters during a motel stickup. Also on hand is a colourful palette of characters. From our narrator Buscape / Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) whose ticket out of the slum is his love of photography over to people like laidback Bene / Benny (Philippe Haagensen), followed by Ze's fierce rival Cenoura / Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele) or good guy turned bad (although it's not so simple) Mane Galinha / Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge) we see a multidimensional, pulsating, alive community that seems in need of a strong, sustained outside push to finally stop chasing its own tail and get out of this destructive cycle.",

            "text": "Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve. The rewards are all too tangible: The football, the music, the heady culture of samba and carnival joie de vivre is never far away, but escaping from the slums of Rio is a little more complicated than sloping off to the beach for the afternoon. The City of God is a raging maelstrom of violence, drugs and gang warfare, and its inhabitants are indoctrinated in the way of the gun from an early age.Fernando Meirelles' film (based on a true story) is a breathtakingly convincing interpretation of life in the notorious Rio favela. Using hundreds of real-life slum children to supplement a superb central cast and shooting entirely around the dusty streets and abject poverty of the neighbourhood, Meirelles charts the history of the area through the narration of Rocket, a peaceable soul with journalistic aspirations who is entirely at odds with the mayhem around him.Rocket explains how the slum was used as a dumping ground for all Rio's undesirables in the 1960s. Despite a population of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, the early part of the film is an homage to plucky underdog cheeriness and community spirit. Rocket's brother is a member of the 'Tender Trio', a dashing group of bandits who go about brandishing pistols and holding up gas trucks like latter day highwaymen. Despite an elegant notoriety, the Trio's crimes tend to yield less than impressive fiscal reward, so they plan a heist on a motel-cum-knocking shop in an attempt to up the ante. It goes badly wrong. The gang's lily-livered tendencies mean they make a sharp exit at the first sniff of trouble but, unbeknownst to them, their lookout, unhappy with his passive role in proceedings (as bored nine-year-old little brothers are wont to be), strolls into the motel and fires at will, chortling psychotically as each hooker and john crumples to the floor.The kid in question is L'il Dice, a chubby Arnold-out-of-Diff'rent-Strokes lookalike with an insatiable lust for mayhem. The motel incident marks a shift in emphasis for the City of God and the following years see the slum descend into chaos as L'il Dice (later renamed L'il Ze) builds a narcotics empire by ruthlessly eliminating the competition. The streets become a recruiting ground for drug dealers and gang lieutenants. Small children (or 'runts' as they are affectionately known) come to see guns and criminal activity as the only viable rungs up the status ladder. 'I smoke, I snort, I've killed and robbed - I'm a man,' one prepubescent boy states defiantly.The film culminates in all-out war between L'il Ze's bunch of hoodlums and an idealistic group of insubordinates who throng behind the handsome Knockout Ned after he stands up to Ze's cruel regime. Meirelles is careful not to lionise Ned. Turning him into a hero figure would, I suppose, have romanticised a bitter and essentially futile conflict. Rocket, caught in the middle of the hostility highlights the ultimate irony: 'By the end, after years of fighting, nobody could remember how it all started,' he says. The war becomes the way of life in the favela. Being affiliated to one of the gangs gives the street kids credibility and, more importantly, access to weapons. Before long, guns are being handed out like lollipops, and the runts are running about excitedly firing their new 'toys' indiscriminately. It is the ultimate in power without responsibility.In their breathless exaltations, many reviewers have dubbed City of God 'Brazil's answer to Goodfellas'. It is a comparison that may be sound in terms of structure  Meirelles has certainly mastered Scorsese's canny editing and daring method of chronicling events over long periods of time  but overall this is a different beast. It is more of a Lord of the Flies with AK-47s. The most alarming aspect of all is the shocking lack of parental presence.This is essential in conveying the choices these street children have (or rather don't have). L'il Ze and his barbaric ilk become all these poor, impressionable little tykes have to aspire to. In short: they don't stand a chance  a fact sharply illustrated in one particularly distressing and almost unwatchable initiation scene where a young gang recruit is required to murder a cornered infant in order to appease his older colleagues.But Meireilles does not let this base, visceral tone swamp his movie. In Rocket he has an inspirational protagonist  the perfect foil to the madness and despair. His coming of age scenes where he bashfully attempts to flirt with girls and lose his virginity; and the sequence where he and his mate resort to petty crime only to bottle out when their intended victims turn out to be 'way too cool' to rob are the glue that holds the drama together. Without the light relief this would be intense and depressing fare.As it is, City of God is a triumph of story-telling: Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling, it is cinema of the very highest order.Do not miss it.10/10",

One thing which clearly comes to mind is \"Lil' Dice's\" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition.",

            "text": "The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker.  Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script.  This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction.  However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed.  The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic.  But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles,  has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing.  Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses.  Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses.  As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath.  Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does.  The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality.  But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior.  The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject.  Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them.  As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person.  Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film.  Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to.  This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros.  Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies.  In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect.  Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed.  The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far.  Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.  Hollywood beware.",

The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film.",

            "text": "This film has been executed with considerable skill - 10/10 for visual and storytelling style. It is brilliant, expert and flawless in its execution.Much of the style is stolen from Scorcese movies, as unashamedly as the characters in the film steal money. I don't mind that, as there's plenty of original invention - I particularly liked a scene in the a room where the time fades from one part of the story to the next, with the room's decor changing, but the camera angle was fixed. Although, I'm sure someone will tell me that wasn't original either. The use of freeze-frame with subtitle is tired now, as it's been done by so many Scorcese wanna-bes in the last 15 years.So this was all very impressive - except I didn't care about any of the characters. I don't know how accurately this is based on the \"true story\", but if the real characters can dispatch each other as carelessly as their fictional versions, and think of nothing but screwing, stealing or killing, I think they must be rather boring company.Much of the action focuses on a man called Li'l Ze who, we are shown, kills people and enjoys it, from a very early age. Why he enjoys it is a question not entertained here, and so he comes across as a rather bland killing machine; at one point, shooting a comrade on the spot for talking to him in an annoying way. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a comedy moment - it certainly came across as one.The one character who isn't obsessed with killing and stealing is the narrator, Busca-Pé, who's ambition is to become a photographer. But he's not really involved in the story, except to be in the right place at the right time to be able to recount it for our benefit. We never see Busca-Pé have much of an effect on events, or express much of an opinion, or even express much emotionally during the constant slaughter. He seems more concerned about losing his virginity than anything else.The way women are portrayed in this film is questionable. They are either objects of sex, having sex, talking about sex, being raped, or being beaten by their men. At no point do we hear what the women of the City of God express their thoughts or feelings on this hellish world in which they exist.In fact, nearly all, if not all, of the characters in this movie appear entirely soulless. Are we supposed to sympathise with Li'l Ze's best friend because he doesn't kill people as wantonly as the rest? Am I supposed to feel empathy for this man because he occasionally persuades Li'l Ze to spare someone's life (meanwhile, coming across as a fairly easy-going chap - something of an achievement, considering the countless killings he's been involved in)?No matter how skillfully this film was made, how well acted, how perfectly constructed, as the body-counted mounted, like the characters in the movie, I didn't really care.",

But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in.Gangster films always seem to make for good dramas (e.g. the Godfather, Goodfellas), where the culture of evil almost always triumphs as the dominant character. This film is no different, but it shows the life of children in places where bribery and corruption reigns supreme. It also shows the bravery of many of these people when even the government won't stick up for them.If you're thinking of starting to watch some foreign language films, this is a good place to start. It is a classic IMO among films made in languages besides English. I did find that the subtitles in this film were done rather poorly (they displayed on my DVD player at the wrong times and it took a few plays to figure out who was saying what.)

            "text": "The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons. This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family. I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Cidade de Deus\" (\"City of God\")",

            "text": "Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, \"The Godfather\" reigns supreme as number one, while \"City of God,\" or more appropriately, \"Cidade de Deus,\" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to \"Crash.\" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, \"City of God\" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and \"The Godfather\" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, \"City of God.\" What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as \"explosive\" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match \"City of God\" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the \"City of God\" itself. Characters float in and out, with the \"out\" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the \"coolest hood in the City of God.\" There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a \"please\" or \"thank you.\" Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes.",

I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made.",

It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city , where teens and children become into burglars and assassins . The movie was not actually shot in Cidade De Deus slum as it was too dangerous ; it was shot in a neighbouring , less dangerous área . Principal actors' interpretation is outstanding , in spite of most are newcomers . All of the amateur actors were recruited from Favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself . Fernando Mereilles direction is awesome and stylish , he even has been hired by Hollywood to make lavish films . The motion picture had an Oscar nomination and obtained a lot of success at box office around the world . The movie is produced by Walter Salles , the best director and production manager from Brazil .The film is rated ¨R¨ for crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys , only for old people (+18) , neither squeamish.

            "text": "I finally got around to watching this much praised movie, and I can certainly understand why so many people have found it fascinating. It is very well done in a technical aspect, and it's easy to be seduced by the way it looks and the constant flow of action scenes, not very different from the efficiency of some glossy & clever commercial. It also shows a way of life and a part of the world that is not very well known to many outsiders, thereby invoking some sense of illumination. Unfortunately, looking beyond the interesting setting & the glossy surface there's not a lot to be found. In 'Cidade de Deus' we follow some dirt poor kids who live as brutal gangsters in a shanty town part of the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro. The kids need money, so they steal, they deal in drugs and they kill. This is the basic plot for the movie. And then what, you may ask? Well, then there's  sadly, pretty much nothing more. What we get here is just a grim world contained within itself, where people perform a lot of horrible acts without really wondering why or thinking about any options or consequences. Now somebody could argue that this is actually the way that many people handle such savage situations, and so this movie is just portraying them in a realistic way. But even then, a filmmaker telling a dramatic story has many opportunities to put things into a broader context and he/she can make the choice to give the audience a more multi-layered view without embellishing anything. If you've seen something like the excellent TV mini-series 'The Corner' you know what I'm talking about. 'Cidade de Deus' makes no attempt to explain why these kids don't have any other opportunities than a life of violent crime, so there's no real critique of the society that produces this horrible condition. Without even a glimpse of the reasons for this, you cannot give any real insight into the desperation that drives the characters to behave in the gruesome ways that they do. Instead it comes across as something that's inevitable and almost natural. Like wild animals eating each other, not because they're forced to by special circumstances that could be changed, but simply because it is their instinct. As we all know this will seldom apply to human beings since our existence is much more complex. Any such complexity is totally missing here. In addition there's not much effort made to show the devastating effects that drugs & brutality has on the human soul. Most of the times when something really awful happens in the story, like children becoming killers or getting killed, it's rapidly followed by some non-emotional scene with some cool music and flashy editing. There's no grieving for the victims, the movie is over 2 hours long & the director spends about 30 seconds of that time showing family members shattered by this unnecessary loss of life, which means there's no depiction of the deep sorrow & hopelessness that extreme poverty & violence creates. We get little or no reflection, just one gun-blasting action followed by another & then another. A lot of stuff for eyes & ears, less for hearts & brains. So 'Cidade de Deus' is a film that looks very good. But for me to agree with IMDb placing it among the top 20 ever made (we're talking higher than 'Citizen Kane', 'Apocalypse Now' & 'The Seventh Seal'), the director's ability to convey the depth of human beings should at least be equal to his flair for technical tricks & brilliance. This is truly far from the case here. I rate it 5/10 for the cinematography & editing and for showing a small piece of a harsh reality without blinders, but for me it felt more like an ordinary action movie than an epic masterpiece.",

I am a man.\"Many who visit Brazil the first time, tend to view Brazilians as lacking serious ambition. They seem to party the night away, and appear to seldom work. The old joke about Brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.But such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in America work to live, sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn, they in Brazil Live to Live. It is a different kind of living, a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. A life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho, and we should have fun while we can before the end comes, but quick.But as the City of God also shows us, Brazilian life is often nasty, brutish and short. A certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. But Director Fernando Meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority, and creates a framework, a structure, that of Gang Rule. The gang-members are not seasoned, old-time criminals like Fredo Corleone or even Tony Montana. Instead, they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. No one is older than 25, partly because of choice, but mainly because no one lives past this age.On the surface, in this context, City of God is a coming of age story of two young people, a sort of Brazilian \"Angels With Dirty Faces.' One character escapes from the City of God, while the other succumbs to it.But when one scratches beneath, one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt City of God in Rio De Janeiro, and a mirror on Brazil itself. Far away from the party hopping, Travel and Leisure postcard perfect white beaches, is another world, one of marauding bands of displaced children.The most surprising thing about City of God is its references to American films. Most Brazilian films, as the films of all countries do, owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. Brazil owes a cultural debt to Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy) and Africa. However, the United States has a far more distant cultural relationship to Brazil. That is where City of God triumphs to me an American film goer. It uses the chapter format made famous in Pulp Fiction and more recently, Kill Bill. It uses the familial structure present in Goodfellas. It uses the 'white-suit cool' present in Miami Vice and the Bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.The fact that City of God can be subtitled Grand Theft Auto: Sao Paolo, is not a surprise nor a mistake. The film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. But the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. Contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.Stylistically, the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. A gangster film never looked this good. It is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches, and kicked around like one of Ronaldinho's headers. It starts on the sand and moves steadily across. It picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. It then leaves us, the film-viewer, with the most indelible image in years as we see Sonia Braga (A world icon and sex symbol of Brazil)'s niece, sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. The innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. It literally takes your breath away.You see the slamming of different, competing themes. You see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach, smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. You see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together, much like the very Culture of Brazil itself.",

He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable \"I can't watch this\" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.",

            "text": "I read four or five pages of reviews for this film on the IMDb boards, and most of them fall into one of two camps - those who felt it was the best, or at least one of the best war movies ever made - and the Spielberg bashers who decry the very fact that America and it's Allies had even the slightest audacity to win the War. Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway? Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.So for me, \"Saving Private Ryan\" isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men. How do you find decency in the hell of warfare? One man at a time.",

            "text": "I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for \"American Stereotypes\"... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian.  My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's \"Juden!\" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you.",

I'd also seen interviews with veterans who'd seen the film and found the film to be incredibly realistic and consequently difficult to watch. Intriguing comments, since we all know there is no shortage of films about war from this century.There are not many films that I've seen that have actually made me physically react to the action on screen. I'm not speaking of the three-dimensional variety either. What I mean to say is this film had me contorting and cringing at the gripping, horrifying action on screen. Somehow the extreme violence can be justified as the whole world knows that this is an important chapter in human history and a startling, graphic depiction only adds more weight to the seriousness of the subject matter. I'd have to say this is probably one of the most important films of the 20th century because of its frank approach to one of the darkest periods of our time on this earth. I am always deeply moved and fiercely proud when given cause to consider those that gave their lives to protect our way of life and liberate those that already suffered dislocation, imprisonment and attempted genocide. These soldiers were truly noble and deserve our deepest gratitude. This sentiment is a common one, and will go some lengths to explain why this film has meant so much to so many.Even with the attention to detail and care taken into how it was shot to accentuate to the fullest degree its realistic approach, it is still hard to imagine what it must have been like to be part of a war. But this film goes a long way to help your mind get around it. It's hard for me to say what kind of impact the cinematography would have on someone watching it on the small screen of a television versus the big screen, but from my perspective, this film really does benefit from a theatrical presentation.What \"Saving Private Ryan\" does extremely well, is show the world the harsh reality of war without pulling any punches. The story about a squad of soldiers sent to retrieve the surviving brother of three dead soldiers is told with competency and due reverence from all perspectives of the characters involved. It is an uncommon and intriguing drama, but it serves as an excuse to describe a setting, rather than the other way around. The story manages to move us through all sorts of different landscapes and scenarios, giving us an unforgettable glimpse of a world unknown to most of us, and terrifying to those who are familiar with it from personal experience.",

Not sure really – I'm not the world's biggest fan of Steven Spielberg, although I'll admit that he's made some good films in his time. Still, it was with some excitement that I sat down to finally watch this lengthy epic of a film, in the best format possible – widescreen DVD, 52\" television, and surround sound system. Unsurprisingly, I was blown away by the production.At the heart, the film recalls dozens of other war films from THE DIRTY DOZEN to THE LONGEST DAY. A squad of men are sent on a suicidal mission, facing almost certain depth. Where the movie excels, however, is in the extra depth and layers that Spielberg adds. The characterisation is strong, the dialogue harsh and heartfelt. Technically, the film is perfect. The colours are faded and washed out and the hand-held camera-work is ten times better than that seen in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Sound effects are excellent, the best I've heard, especially the incredibly suspenseful sound of tanks approaching at the film's climax. All these technicalities combine to make the battle scenes some of the most desperately realistic I've seen. The opening twenty minutes on Omaha Beach, which show the infamous D-Day landings, are everything you've heard: exhilarating, utterly depressing, disturbing, exciting, and gruesome. This is certainly the goriest war film out there and it's all portrayed in a matter-of-fact way; blink and you really will miss it. People explode, lose limbs, and bleed copiously from wounds; only strong stomachs need apply.The acting is uniformly great, as you'd expect from the calibre of cast on view. Tom Hanks has never been better as the shellshocked hero, with unforgettable mannerisms – the shaking hand still haunts me. Tom Sizemore arguably steals the show as the gruff sergeant, and his larger-than-life persona is well suited to a role than the one he plays here. Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg put in solid performances but it's Jeremy Davies who the film focuses on throughout – a rookie, green-faced communications officer thrown straight into the hell of warfare. The viewer understandably sees the film through Davies' eyes and the subsequent journey is everything you would imagine it to be. Additionally, the film boasts great turns from actors in lesser roles – especially Barry Pepper as the sniper and Vin Diesel at his best. Lots of familiar faces pad out other roles, some in cameos: Dennis Farina, Ted Danson, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi, Paul Giamatti, the list goes on.Despite the near-three hour running time, the film never slows up or stops for a minute. Every second is crucial and beautifully crafted. Things culminate in a set-piece climax, a fierce ambush in a bombed-out French town. Our heroes attempt to destroy a brigade of Nazi troops and their vehicles and heavy guns. It's sprawling, explosive, upsetting and, by the last frame of the film, incredibly moving. So, in retrospect, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is everything everybody says it is. Spielberg's best film by far and one of the best war films of all time.",

You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in \"Saving Private Ryan\" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way.",

But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like \"proud to be an American\" or \"part of American History\" or \"every American should see this movie\".First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's  \"The Bridge\" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be \"good\" or \"best\"? \"Saving Private Ryan\" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with \"Schindler's List\", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality.",

            "text": "War films can be broken into two basic categories; the propaganda film, which celebrates bravery and patriotism; and the anti-war film, which shows the suffering and futility of war. The most extreme propaganda films are usually produced when a war is threatened or actually in progress and either demonize or belittle the individual enemy soldier. This is useful for both inspiring the home front and for assuring it that there will be an ultimate victory. While these films play well with a wartime audience they appear somewhat silly when viewed in a post-war environment. An exception to this war-in-progress concept was is \"Saving Private Ryan\". Cloaked in an anti-war facade, this film was more typical of what would have been produced in 1944 (its setting) than 1998 (its year of release). Under its thin anti-war facade of realistic looking destruction, Private Ryan breaks with the characterization elements that are essential for classification as an anti-war work. Almost by definition anti-war films use a faceless enemy (\"Paths of Glory\") or portray the enemy soldier as sharing in the suffering and futility of war (\"The Enemy Below\"). Often they are portrayed as victims of a fanatical leadership and the audience is invited to identify with or at least understand them (\"The Longest Day\"). This is because after a war, both the victors and the vanquished have an incentive to portray their enemy as brave and determined, otherwise victory is hollow and defeat is humiliating. Not so in Private Ryan; if the German battle performance and basic infantry tactics shown in the film were representative of what was actually practiced, a single allied division could have occupied all of Germany by the end of June 1944. The final battle scene alone makes the viewer wonder how, facing such a totally inept enemy, the war could have gone on more than a few days after the D-Day Landings. Among the most obvious:A sequence where American soldiers run back and forth in front of a Tiger I tank without drawing the fire of the tank's machine guns. These tanks had internally operated machine guns, which would have easily cut down these soldiers. Knowing this the soldiers would not have exposed themselves to this fire. Tanks entering an urban area ahead of infantry, driving down the middle of the town as if on parade. Instead infantry would flank any defensive position on the street and secure the area immediately ahead of the tanks so they do not come into range of anti-tank weapons. These tactics were validated during early fighting on the Russian front and became operational imperatives for all Panzer units. A Hitler Youth dagger found in the trench right after the first bunker is taken on the beach. The men in these bunkers were mostly older second-tier draftees and Ukrainian conscripts. Normandy was not expected to be the invasion target and it's highly unlikely that a member or former member of the Hitler Youth would have been assigned to these marginal units. But it was an excellent way to make the audience less squeamish about the brutality inflicted by the allied soldiers when these German units attempted to surrender.So just what is \"Saving Private Ryan\"? The first 24 minutes are a high budget remake of the \"Longest Day\" whose less expensive landing sequence conveyed more tactical believability about the process of securing a beachhead. The next 90 minutes are a mistake-ridden, choppy, and contrived remake of \"The Big Red One\". Ultimately, this overlong odyssey said less about patrolling behind enemy lines than \"Kelly's Heroes\"- a counterculture comedy whose serious scenes and character development were superior in almost every way. Then there is the finale, a total rip-off of Arthur Pohl's \"The Bridge\" (1949), which focused on a handful of recently conscripted German schoolboys who fight for control of an inconsequential bridge during the last weeks of the war. They were at the bridge because of a series of accidents and they naively stayed there because of their youthful idealism and sense of duty. Like Private Ryan, most do not survive the engagement. What is notable is not that Pohl was able to make a much better film for a fraction of the cost (that is not particularly unusual), but that he was able to convey more perspective four years after the event than Spielberg could manage 50 years later.But these criticisms of Private Ryan are based on the assumption that Spielberg's intent was to make a worthwhile war film and there is simply nothing to support this assumption. More likely Spielberg's agenda was make money while subtly refuting post-war portrayals (such as \"Das Boot\" and \"Cross of Iron\") of the German soldier as something more than the sub- human creature of WWII propaganda days or the cartoon villains of his own \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" series. The genius of Private Ryan is its success in packaging this sick message inside a commercially successful film. At the time of its release and its almost universal acclaim, this aspect of the film was largely unrecognized (and unexamined) by both audiences and critics. In this respect it owes less to the war films it shamelessly plagiarizes than to early 1950's cinema, where McCarthy-paralyzed Hollywood directors resorted to subtle themes that went undetected by studio executives and regulators. Only recently has its status begun to erode as individual critics more carefully examine its elements, away from the euphoria that surrounded its initial releaseAlthough \"Saving Private Ryan was popular, remember that the \"Rat Patrol\" ran for 58 episodes, watched by television audiences who were also entertained by similar silly nonsense.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

I got emotional during the last scene in this film as it really makes you feel for the character. The story goes as Tom Hank's character is tasked to find and save the only Ryan brother as all of his other brothers are K.I.A. and Hank's performance as a soldier in World War 2 is possibly the most realistic as it shows the horrors that troops saw during the assaults. Matt Damon as Ryan is also very good as he was relatively young which adds to how young soldiers were sent to hell to fight the Japs. The last scene really hit the heart for me and creates the best emotional resonance. The incredible special effects really show the true gritty reality of war. This film is not like previous classic war movies such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns of Navarone where they somewhat glorify being in war. Saving Private Ryan is among the greatest of Spielberg. Today, there have been similar gritty movies of war such as Fury and Hacksaw Ridge but for me, this is better than those. Overall, I highly recommend seeing this obviously take into count the lengthy running time but it is well worth it.",

            "text": "Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article \"Best War Movie Ever Made\"\" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film. It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As \"entertaining\" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the \"lulls,\" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is \"memorable,\" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period.",

I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times.

I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed.",

            "text": "Alright, folks, gather 'round because I just watched \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and oh boy, do I have some thoughts! Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg and released in 1998, this movie is a jaw-dropping, heart-pounding, and tear-jerking depiction of World War II. Let me tell you, it's like no other war film I've ever seen.So, the story is about a group of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (played by the ever-impressive Tom Hanks), who are on a mission to find and bring home this guy, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). This poor dude has already lost all his brothers in the war, and now he's the last one left.Now, let me tell you, the opening scene is an absolute doozy! It's a no-holds-barred, in-your-face portrayal of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It's intense, gory, and downright horrifying, but it's also incredibly gripping. I was on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen, heart pounding in my chest.Tom Hanks is, as always, a freakin' treasure. He plays the role of Captain Miller with such depth and vulnerability that it's impossible not to feel for the guy. And the rest of the cast? Top-notch! They bring these soldiers to life with such raw emotion and camaraderie that you can't help but root for them.What I loved most about this movie was the balance between edge-of-your-seat action and heart-wrenching character development. I was totally invested in these characters, their stories, and the friendships that were forged in the crucible of war. Spielberg nailed it, showing us the devastating emotional toll war takes on the human soul.Oh, and let's not forget the phenomenal cinematography and sound design! The camera work is chaotic and disorienting, perfectly mirroring the confusion and terror on the battlefield. And the sound? Let's just say you might want to make sure your neighbors are cool with the sound of gunfire and explosions because it's that intense!Sure, \"Saving Private Ryan\" has its flaws. The pacing can be a bit slow here and there, and some of the characters' motivations could be fleshed out a bit more. But honestly, these are just minor gripes in an otherwise spectacular film.In conclusion, if you haven't seen \"Saving Private Ryan\" yet, what the heck are you waiting for?! This movie is a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping, and unforgettable experience that'll leave you speechless. It's a must-watch, folks, so grab some popcorn, brace yourself, and get ready for one heck of a ride!",

            "text": "Great film is an illuminating thing: it shines its light into the dark recesses of humanity, revealing the greed, hatred, and hypocrisy that fester there. Bad film is often just as revealing: its existence and reception serve as a mirror reflecting the hearts of its intended audience. Saving Private Ryan is a classic example of the latter, in the flickering light of its propagandistic glow, the American people stand revealed for what they really are: stupid, self-absorbed, morally unsophisticated rubes ready to be fleeced by the first charlatan who comes along and tells them what they want to hear.\"Saving Private Ryan\" is typical Steven Spielberg fare: a big budget spectacle, bereft of style, filled to the brim with childishly heavy-handed moralizing and peopled with facile \"characters\" who exist only as cardboard cutouts for the ensuing morality play. Even the film's underlying subtext is an old Spielberg standby - America GOOOOOD, Nazis BAAAAD. The plot of Saving Private Ryan revolves around a simple moral question: is saving one life worth potentially sacrificing the lives of many? This fourth grade ethical dilemma is played out for nearly three hours over the background of the brocage of Normandy in the hours and days immediately after the D-Day landings, and is handled with Spielberg's usual wandering attention, ham-fisted lack of subtlety and babbling pop psychology. Spielberg being Spielberg, there's never any doubt how the question will ultimately be answered (hint: with saccharine sentimentality in front of a tombstone - because, obviously, the same scene wasn't manipulative enough when it was used to close Schindler's List). The film opens with thirty minutes of unremitting carnage as US soldiers assault Omaha Beach. This opening scene has been hailed for its savage realism, but it is in truth one of the more cynically manipulative sequences in recent memory, full of irritating, disorienting jump cuts, pornographically Gibsonesque attention to gory detail, camera tricks and special effects artifices, all accompanied by a deafening soundtrack designed to overwhelm our capacity to think about what is being portrayed on the screen and to push us to simply immerse ourselves in its reductive US vs. Them POV. When I saw this film in the theaters, the audience cheered when the first German soldier was killed, then cheered again when American troops murdered surrendering Germans in cold blood: this, I'm sure, was Spielberg's intent.Having bulldozed and buried any hint of the moral ambiguity of war, Spielberg gets around to the heart of the movie. It has been discovered by the War Department that one Private Ryan (Matt Damon) is now the sole surviving son of a family who has sent five sons to war. Unfortunately, Ryan was a part of the paratrooper drop that preceded the Normandy landings and is missing behind enemy lines. In a moment of supreme hokum (complete with a quotation of a letter by Abraham Lincoln that wouldn't feel out of place in a Ken Burns documentary), Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Marshall (Harve Presnell) decides that an effort will just have to be made to save Private Ryan.At this point, Saving Private Ryan becomes just another motley-crew-of-experts flick. A team of caricatures is assembled: the tough-as-nails seargent; the feisty Italian; the pious Southern sniper with Talent on Loan from God (if the historical setting had been Vietnam, I'm sure this character would have been replaced by Cuba Gooding Jr. as The Magic Negro); the REMF pussy - all led by Tom Hanks in the role of Tom Hanks, Captain Everyman. Call them the Sanitized Seven. Battles ensue. Some of the caricatures die (does anyone really remember which ones?). The Germans never miss an opportunity to remind us how EVIL they are. One wehrmacht man - having been saved from certain death at the hands our intrepid heroes by the earnest pleas of the REMF - returns only to slowly and sadistically stab an American to death. Oh those tricksy Krauts! In the end, Ryan is saved and Tom Hanks is dying. But it was all worth it. Cue the graveside maundering. USA! USA! USA!The problem with Saving Private Ryan is the problem with everything Spielberg touches. More broadly, it is the problem of the American commercial cinema. Lacking the courage of any real conviction, it cannot offer any challenge to its audience. Instead, it panders to that audience with easy answers, impressive effects, a soundtrack that booms and tinkles in all the right places and a nice mom's apple pie pat on the back for every red blooded American. What's missing is even the faintest glimmer of awareness that the world doesn't break down neatly into heroes and villains, cowards and the courageous, us and them. In the place of subtlety, it gives us spectacle, in the place of art, it delivers technically proficient propaganda.",

            "text": "My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:\nMemento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular \"Nolan's spirit\" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.\nSPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - \"extractors\" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called \"inception\". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels \"dream within a dream\", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.\nSome short lines about the cast:\nLeo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.",

There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!",

            "text": "What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a \"forger\" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If \"Inception\" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards.",

            "text": "I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that \"shocking ending\" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb's main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's father-in-law. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island, You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind – which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn't enough, there is Ellen page's character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I'm fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It's the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy's mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don't care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren't high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I'm only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I'm not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe's character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don't give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don't tell us what consequences it would have, they don't show us what happens with the company, they don't do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn't like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn't really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I'll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here's the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it's stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it's a stupid cop out on Nolan's part. An excuse for all the things that didn't make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience.",

With Christopher Nolan of \"Memento\" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, \"Inception\" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination.

Making a complex story that someone could answer with only one sentence. You're waiting for that line for whole content. But most of the contents (I mean movie or TV Series) are not managing that well.Besides the greatness of the storyline this movie has a really great cast. So Acting Performances are also great.

I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon...",

When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as \"a film that rewards intellect\", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent.",

            "text": "Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" (2010) is a complex science fiction thriller about a group of people with varying specific skills that create a perfect team of dream-sharers. Dom Cobb, the main protagonist, is an extractor who is able to find out people's secrets by intruding into their dreams. His right-hand is Arthur, who researches and plans what they are trying to accomplish in a dream. Bright graduate student Ariadne is the architect for the dreams, meaning she literally constructs the physical aspects of a dreamscape. Eames is a professional at turning into anyone else in a dream, almost like shapeshifting. Lastly, Yusuf is a chemist who creates perfect concoctions of sedatives to achieve ideal conditions for the dreams to take place. This elaborate combination of characters is asked by a rich businessman, Saito, to infiltrate his dying competitor's son, Robert Fischer's, dream and place an idea in his mind so that Saito's business can become more successful. Traveling through the layers of someone's mind and making them think of an idea on their own is what they call \"inception.\" Cobb is dedicated to making this happen so that Saito can arrange for Cobb's return to America to see his children. Without Saito, Cobb would not be able to return to America because of his alleged criminal background, but Saito has connections and power to clear his name. Some members of his team think achieving inception is impossible, but Cobb convinces them to be on board and they must come up with a mastermind plan with no room for error to achieve this extremely difficult yet imperative task. They begin a three-layer plan that involves elaborate depths of the dream dimension, taking advantage of Fischer's sensitive and dysfunctional relationship with his father, practiced methods of leaving a dream and entering the next, all while trying to avoid Cobb's wife Mal who lives in his subconscious and often sabotages his plans. The shocking ending leaves viewers at a cliffhanger and fans theorizing.Now that I've gone over the plot, let's talk about the other components of the film. The marketing strategies did an excellent job gathering hype for the film. The movie poster features the famous actors that everyone was excited to see, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Elliot Page, and the rest of the dream crew. It also says \"Inception\" in a large red font and notes that is directed by the same director of \"Dark Knight,\" which was an insanely successful and highly rated movie that was premiered two years prior to Inception. Dark Knight scored a 94% on rotten tomatoes and is #112 on IMBD's most popular movie list. This likely drew in the audience from Christopher Nolan's movies and set a high expectation for the quality of Inception. Another great marketing move was the contents of the teaser trailer. The trailer features a brief voiceover of Leonardo DiCaprio and amazing scenes with impressive cinematography taken out of context that show the viewers the production value and exciting action contents of the film all while confusing them so that they go see the film when it is released. I think the shock factor and science fiction aspect of the trailer is owed to the scene where a city block starts to fold over top of itself.The content of the film stayed true to the marketing because the cinematography, directing, and acting is quite well-done. Starting with the cinematography, the zero gravity scenes and cityscape building from the ground up were very realistic looking and intensified the movie watching experience. There was a lot of attention to detail. The directing of Inception is very montage based. It draws amounts and amounts of suspense. For example, the montage near the end of the film with the van, the fortress, and the hotel was painfully long but created such thick suspense. For the acting, I only have compliments and no complaints. Inception was casted beautifully and everyone fit their roles perfectly. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job as Dom Cobb, especially in the emotional scene with his wife and two kids in one of the dreams. My personal favorite performance was Cillian Murphy's role as Robert Fischer. He played as his character really well and he captured his relatively constant sadness surrounding his father situation.Inception is a staple film in the science fiction genre and is similar to a few other sci-fi movies as well. Inception is at #135 on IMBD's most popular movie list and has a rating of 87% on rotten tomatoes, so there is no doubt about its quality. In my opinion, Inception is pretty similar to the well-loved movie \"The Matrix\" (1999) starring Keanu Reeves. They are both iconic science fiction and action films with themes of alternate realities. The second film I think is very similar is a more recent film, Tenet (2020) with Robert Pattinson. Tenet is also about bending the rules of science and is also directed by Christopher Nolan. If you enjoyed either of these movies, I recommend Inception. I also recommend it to general fans of Christopher Nolan's directing, so if you have watched and enjoyed any of his films, you would probably like Inception too.On my rating scale of one to five, with one being the worst possible score and five being perfect, I give Inception a five. It has no weaknesses in my opinion. Every aspect of this movie combines into perfection. The acting and cinematography is what takes it over the top, and I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cillian Murphy in all of the roles they play. This is a movie I have voluntarily watched multiple times and it only gets better with each watch. It is very complex and a complete experience to view. My favorite aspect of the film is the ending. Many people say they hate cliffhangers, but I enjoy them because it leaves it up to the audience to imagine. Basically, you can choose your own ending based on what you think makes the most sense with the facts you are given in the film.",

            "text": "Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. \"Inception\" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. \"The Matrix\" (1999), \"The Cell\" (2000), \"Abre Los Ojos\" (1997) & its American remake \"Vanilla Sky\" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.\"Inception\" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the \"Matrix\" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.",

            "text": "Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.",

            "text": "This film really let me down.I didn't expect a great film but I expected something that was at least 'OK'. How wrong I was. I honestly can't understand the hype. 'Intelligent' they say?? What sort of intelligent film has to have it's protagonists explain what is happening continuously throughout the film?? Now Memento, that was a good film. And, I suppose, 'intelligent'. But by intelligent, I mean something that pushes boundaries of the viewer's understanding. I don't mean intelligent as in 1) able to do simple arithmetic, 2) develop reading and writing skills and 3) generally being one notch above a dolphin.OK, let's make a start shall we? Firstly, one of the greatest literary and cinematic arts is the use of metaphor. This film has none. One thing the film is full of is too much explanatory dialogue (not to mention pre-teen psychology - the father figure relationship in the subconscious). For example, in the first Matrix film, the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor (a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed). In this film here, everything is painstakingly explained. To me, this speaks volumes.Secondly, great actors, yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean, Ellen Page was great in Juno, but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does. In the same way that every character does. They ALL speak the same way and we are no better understanding one character by the end of the film than we were when they first appeared.Thirdly, logic. Philosophy. Call it what you want. Why was Ariadne chosen to become the architect? What does she actually DO??And Ken Watanabe. Why is he alive after dying on the third or fourth level 'down' in the subconscious after the film so adamantly stresses the dangers of dying in the 'dream'? How can he wake up on the plane?? Why, in fact, is there that scene at the start of the film where he appears old and which features the safe and the confidential papers Leonardo De Caprio finds.Why does Leonardo De Caprio constantly have to furrow his brow? Oh, yes, it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has, unfortunately for him, such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snow-covered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly, if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why, o why does he have to be the main character in this film? Couldn't the team work with someone more well-balanced?? Can he in fact be any use to his kids if he eventually finds them???Nonsense nonsense nonsense. Big pile of nonsensical psycho-babble. And yes, where else but America???",

The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending.",

            "text": "Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com",

            "text": "What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! \"What is the most resilient parasite? An idea\" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around \"Extractors\", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, \"Inception\" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!",

            "text": "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",

A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.Meanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.To finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes.

My criticism of G v K (the ending in particular) and this movie is that so much of it is far-fetched and fantasy based. Much more cartoonish.The bottom line is, they're making the monsters out to have too much human intelligence when they should actually be more animalistic. This was like watching a superhero movie and in my opinion, making the monsters out to be superheroes is a huge mistake. That's what happened when Toho did this in the 60's/70's which resulted in Godzilla movies becoming silly, low-budget kids movies, which has since been ridiculed for decades and has tarnished Godzilla's image. I understand the writers are trying to be creative and give the fans something different from all of the other monster movies out there, but this can be done without all the cheese.

In my opinion if Legendary Studios wants to include humans, they should at least try making them just little interesting or just remove them completely. None of them is doing anything necessary, furthermore whatever they're doing doesn't make any sense. Why the hell are they in the Hollow Earth without protection? One guy is just in a Hawaiian shirt. The amount of dangerous monsters is not alarming, I guess... Paper Boy is filming everything but the British guy in a Hawaiian shirt says something like: It's better to keep it in a secret, this ancient civilization shouldn't be exposed to our world. The girl from Godzilla Vs. Kong (she is from that world and has weird X-Men power (?)) is among modern people, so the world already knows the underground world. What does he want to hide? There is more of this stupidity.About the monsters:\nKong is the lead. His journey is simple, he feels lonely, he wants to have a family of his kind. From the trailers you know, there is more giant apes, so I am happy to see them because I am Team Kong :) I'd want to appreciate the \"dialogues\" between Kong and this little ginger fella. They don't use words as we do but believe me, these two are more interesting than the humans. You will enjoy it.Godzilla and the rest are just monsters. Sadly Godzilla isn't intimidating in this movie, his only goal is to gain the pink level of nuclear power and then use it to fight the bad monkey. However, the fight scenes are awesome - this is why we are watching this type of movies, so if you're a fan of giant monsters, I recommend Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire... and don't expect to see raise of \"the new empire\" in this movie. It's a kinda awkward title generated by ChatGPT.",

And don't get me started on Godzilla getting an upgrade and becoming pink after killing another titan who never even antagonized him.

The only decent monsterverse movies in my opinion are the first Godzilla and Kong Skull Island. The others in the franchise are just dumb.

For one, there's a bit less silliness. There's comic relief of course, but it's not out of place or goofy. The 80's throwbacks with the tunes, synths, and vibes were great. And lastly, the Titans were back to being the bad guys instead of humans. I always find it a bore when you watch a movie about monsters fighting, but have to bare through a story of human villains and their idiotic ideologies.A side note, it's hilarious that these Titans seem to really enjoy having their royal rumbles in the biggest cities on the planet, or while destroying some of the world's most revered structures. Like really guys, you couldn't have thrown down in the middle of the Sahara? More destruction equals more entertainment I suppose. Also, Godzilla just casually murders hundreds if not thousands just walking around from point A to point B. I digress. Go pink Zilla!",

            "text": "Releasing merely weeks after the critically and commercially acclaimed \"Godzilla Minus One\" won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is a boon as well as bane for \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" - while more people are familiar with the behemoth radioactive lizard, there is an undeniable urge to draw comparisons between the two movies. Adam Wingard's second Monsterverse film following 2021's \"Godzilla vs Kong\" delivers satisfying Titan action, but overall, the film feels like a step back, largely owing to dull and tedious human drama.Personally, I found \"Godzilla vs Kong\" to be the best Monsterverse film. It embraced the absurdity and silliness of its premise and made the most of it to deliver one hell of a show, placing the Titans front and centre, while jettisoning any unnecessary human drama. \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" starts off much slower, with the actual plot taking nearly 20 minutes to kick in. Combined with an uptick in uninteresting human drama, this slows down the movie with certain portions feeling boring.Much like its predecessor, \"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" struggles trying to the connect the stories of the two leading titans. Kong is the heart and soul of the movie, with Godzilla largely feeling like an accomplice or sidekick. The first half of the movie is almost entirely about Kong's exploration of Hollow Earth, the subterranean ecosystem where the Titans live. While learning about the mystical world was engaging and intriguing, it lead to a delayed introduction of the villain, leading to the third act feeling slightly rushed and less rewarding compared to the enthralling finale of \"Godzilla vs Kong\".The action sequences themselves are a whole lot of fun, with a face off in hollow earth with gravity slightly messed-up being one of my favourites of the entire franchise. The finale in Rio delivers plentiful excitement and fun too.\"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire\" is best suited for fans of the Showa era. For Kong fans(like myself), there is a lot to like about the movie, owing to the humanisation of the great ape. The action scenes are fun, colourful and campy, similar to it's predecessor, but an increased focus on human characters and a slower pace make this a slightly underwhelming entry to the Monsterverse.",

The movie is filled with monkeys throughout, making it more like an independent Kong film because it barely depicts Godzilla, with Kong having far more screen time than Godzilla. I feel like Godzilla's role was forcefully added and feels disconnected from the rest of the movie. Also, the portrayal of SHIMO is superficial, failing to showcase its power, while Skar King is portrayed as a clown; it can't even defeat King Kong one-on-one, lacking a strong antagonist that leads to a rushed conclusion of the final battle. Finally, I have a big question: why do the director and writers like monkeys so much?",

The jokes land a bit better this time around. The aura & creative decisions in this film have almost an 80's vintage vibrant feel, the music & color palette compliment each other perfectly along with cinematography.My issues? Well... why does the movie have Monarch being okay with bringing anybody down to hollow earth? Reliance on slight jumpy exposition, small things that could have been explored a little more to leave more an impact. It's not perfect for those, however I will argue this film was a lot closer to striking close to being perfect than you would think a film of this caliber could do.This is what happens when Cinematography, awareness, consistency & finding the footing on following Kaijus, gets the best of a cinematic experience, it's just as much a kaiju story as it is a human story & It's a Love Letter to the showa era & fans should be proud.I've never been more invested in the actual story of the kaijus until this movie, expositions & humans don't ruin it either this time. It's not anything special, but what is special are what we are here for, & that's the Kaijus.New Empire, by far, has the longest showtime for Kaiju action that I've ever seen in a monster flick. Beautifully shot cinematic camera scenes, there is one specific upside down shot unfolding to the right side up, just amazing cameraworkThe gradual building blocks embedded in the story left exciting awe in entertainment & care of handling Kaiju moments. The humans are just enhancers for the monsters. Compared to GVK, they have a better direction here without getting lost.It's a ride, took the issues of GVK & corrected it more, there's plenty of action if not more than you'd think... there's plenty of surprises, emotional character moments with humans/monsters, & although a not so perfect expositions still a solid fun plot/story following the elements at play... Godzilla X Kong was a lot better than I thought it was going to be & that's worth something.7.5 / 10.",

Now the thing is, the reason I am saying wow, is for a few big reasons that can probably relate to a lot of regular humans like me because I am most definitely human and not Godzilla trying to promote his own film. The reasons being; CGI, Big monster go rahh, and epic battle scenes. Anything else is boring and I frankly could care less about in this film because it affects nothing and all I care about are the things that THE FILM IS ACTUALLY ABOUT (humans).First, I wanna start off by saying that comparing this film's CGI to Godzilla Minus One (greatest Godzilla film that actually made me care about humans), budget wise, is like an insult. GMO had a budget near abouuuut 20 million or so, while GXK had 10x the budget. GMO managed to achieve winning an Oscar with 100x less visual art employees and having the best and probably the most realistic large scale CGI I've seen ever. BUT, the CGI even with such a smaller film beating it, is still excellent as always and doesn't look like some PS5 game that was reprogrammed to run on a Nintendo Switch, unlike other films. It has definitely been one of the consecutive aspects of the MonsterVerse.Monsters; I'm a sucker for Godzilla, not so much Kong, but this version of him definitely catches my eye. Godzilla and Shimo were what really brought this film together, and the funny thing is, before I saw Godzilla with pink atomic breath, it was my most disliked color, but on him, it's my preferred look for him. I also already loved cold related things so a big beast like Shimo definitely made me see this film.Battle Scenes. Now I know, I know, not all Godzilla films can entirely be epic fight scenes, I'M JUST SAYING, I wish they were longer. They are definitely what everyone, including me, came to see, and I am beyond glad with the outcome of the film, that I totally didn't see coming (that's sarcasm), and I actually would love to see more of the franchise, whatever it may be. Also to anyone who disliked the movement speed of Godzilla, watch literally any dated Godzilla film.In summary, I love Godzilla, Dune Part Two and GMO still beat it by an inconceivable number, but if you like big monsters or just Godzilla in General, watch this, maybe watch it again, or just watch the fight scene clips.",

They're not as frequently annoying, but when you have a small cast of humans, the sense of danger dissipates, because no one is the kind of character that could die at any point before the very end (and even then).

It ends very suddenly, the two titular monsters take a while to meet up, and though I liked the main villain, he takes too long to be introduced.

Kong is the character in this part exactly as he should be, a true leader who is ready to go to the end to save everyone he cares about. Is stopped, in the course of the film an inexplicable connection with Godzilla as well as with Mothra is born, which connects these two Alpha Titans in a unique way.Scar King is one of the strongest antagonists out of all the parts. Although the movie comes together, you haven't seen half of it, a merciless and terrible tyrant who stops at nothing for his throne! I won't say anything about Shimuo, one of the greatest A titans! This movie deserves everything recommendations and hopefully more parts in the future!",

Fortunately, this time it was so entertaining that you can ignore the dumb parts.And of course, it's not an ambitious movie, there's a lot of cliche, oversimplification etc., but I still expected worse. Most of the time humans are not acting like idiots, their crazy ideas are pretty convincing within this world and the whole cast does a great job keeping us entertained. Relations between our human characters work pretty well.There's a lot of worldbuilding here, successfull one in my opinion. Ancient civilization, prophecies, stories written on walls, some scores to even. The Hollow Earth looks great, you can see how this whole ecosystems works with its own rules.And finally, Titans. CGI is really good, fight scenes don't disappoint and, the most important thing, monsters act like they should act. There's startegy, there's a lot of preparing, but also there's hierarchy, decisions made out of fear and fights for territory. Writers managed to make the Titans seem humane while also staying within their animal nature. The outcome of that is convincing, at least for me.Some people might have a problem with the fact that most of this movie is basically assembilng the team for the final battle, but I think this time Monsterverse used a cliche in pretty much the best way possible.In the end, Godzilla x Kong is a satisfying and engaging blockbuster as well as great addition to the franchise. I wonder, how are they gonna beat that in the next one...",

The film introduces the emotions we had from the previous movie: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust. We are also introduced to new emotions: embarrassment, Ennui (boredom), Envy and Anxiety.Riley is about to go to high school but the story focuses on her preparation to officially join the FogHorn Hockey team. As the story progresses, Riley finds herself challenged with her hopes to join the team. Her friendship was wounded, her emotions went all over the place and the pressure got into her head. But eventually, everything goes into their proper places.This sequel film may be animated and made for kids but as an adult, it just hits differently. I can say that this film was partially made for adults and for anyone who is in a bad mental situation. It reminds its viewers how growing older can be tough, how overthinking affects everything else, how decisions that are made today may affect what's next. But it is also a strong reminder that problems, fear, worries and anxieties will come. They are all inevitable but everything will pass. Take a deep breath, stay calm and do not overstress everything. Having a calm mind also affects the way we think. We may feel pressure at any given time but we have to sit back and relax.Do not overstress things at the present. Live at the moment. The future is there but we live at the present, right here, right now. Enjoy life. Remember that you are not alone on whatever you are facing. Keep your friends and family close. And finally, God is always with us.Inside Out 2 is a great film. Every audience will have a different way of enjoying this but just remember, you are who you are. Embrace yourself.#InsideOut2 #moviereview.",

            "text": "Inside Out 2 (2024) is a powerful sequel to the acclaimed Pixar film, delving deeper into the emotional tragedies and joys of adolescence. This new chapter follows Riley Andersen (voiced by Kensington Tallman) as she transitions from middle school to high school, encountering the turbulence of puberty and stumbling through new social situations.Riley, fresh from middle school graduation, is invited to join a summer hockey trial by her local coach who she is completely in adoration of and amazed that her and her friends got invited. She faces anxiety about high school separation from her close friends, who will be attending different schools. Her sense of self is just staring to solidify despite the bad news about her besties. She really hopes they can stay connected through their shared passion for hockey.As Riley confronts these changes, new emotions like Anxiety, Envy, and Embarrassment emerge. These emotions create a challenging internal dynamic, especially when Riley meets Valentina \"Val\" Ortiz, the admired captain of the high school hockey team. Anxiety begins to dominate, banishing all older emotions we got to know in the first Inside Out out from the headquarters and literally into the Vault where recessed memories are kept. This causes Riley to lose confidence and strain her friendships as she attempts to fit in with her new high school peers.Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust go on a mission to help Riley retain her sense of self. In addition, the visual elements were all quite amazing. It's like a mental model of what the brain actually looks like. With all the storage units, and the workers trying to put things in the right place, and then the deep-sated secret memories were inside the vault. All of these aspects made the movie seem even more realistic, and made it feel like I actually have that inside my own brain. Through their journey, they realize that every emotion, including the new ones, plays a crucial role in shaping Riley's identity and helping her navigate adolescence's complexities. The film emphasizes the importance of embracing all emotions to truly understand oneself.Watching Inside Out 2 was an emotional rollercoaster for me. The film masterfully conveyed the emotions of growing up, making me feel sadness, fear, and excitement along with Riley. There were moments where I was on the edge of my seat, anxious about Riley's choices and hoping she would find her true self again. By the end of the movie, Riley gains more than just her original self; she understands what it truly means to be herself, embracing all parts of her emotional spectrum.Inside Out 2 beautifully captures the essence of growing up, making us laugh, cry, and reflect on the importance of understanding and accepting all parts of ourselves.",

Though I get emotions are difficult & complex to understand, even for adults (as shown perfectly by Inside Out 1&2), I guess no harm will come from saying something to them before watching the movie. My seatmates came with their kid (est. Age 5-8) and the parent had such a difficult time explaining the complexities of different emotions DURING THE MOVIE. Kids are confused and WILL ask questions, guide them to see what the message of this movie is trying to say. It will help them to understand their emotions as they grow up. Make the experience more meaningful. Anyways, just keep in mind of cinema etiquette I guess...But with that, I LOVED this movie. I have never been so validated and seen in my life. In the media today, we all see how anxiety is portrayed but never how it really is. This movie just explained why I am the way I am, and maybe even how to live life even when things get overwhelming and complicated. If anything, ALL of our emotions are important. There's this one line by Joy that is so perfectly said. It struck out to me so much since my dad died when I was 19. Just before \"adulthood\", just before anything really. So I shut everything out. My last year of being a teenager came to waste because of the daily breakdowns. I forgot how to live. I forgot how to be happy. I became so numb to the point that everything became black & white. I was on auto-pilot and I didn't even notice it until everything came crashing down.This movie has highlighted what I have been going through for the past year and showing how wrong it was to shut the grief out. Emotions are meant to be felt. Life is overwhelming BUT Life is meant to be lived.There's this one cartoon-ish character that really brought me flashbacks as a 2000s kid. HAHAH kudos to the person who thought of that. Then again, I wish they(😉) had more depth to them (in a way).Overall, I think this movie is perfect for everyone, though I think this movie is best for pre-teens, teens, & adults.",

And the whole message of balancing your emotions felt so correct as it was what helped me most during my own teenage years, and their display of an anxiety attack was also well executed and felt relatable to my own experience.Overall, it was wrtitten beautifully, and executed perfectly, the new emotions added a lot of depth and the whole experience left me happy crying out of the cinema, could you really ask for more? :)So yeah, go watch it, we were all teenagers once, you won't be disappointed.",

She's excelling in hockey, and she and her friends are selected to attend a hockey camp. However, she discovers her friends won't be going to her high school and meets some new girls who will. She begins experiencing new, strange emotions while navigating this transition and going through puberty. How will her old emotions handle the surge of new emotions to help Riley through this adjustment period?This film is directed by Kelsey Mann, in her directorial debut, and features the voices of Amy Poehler (Baby Mama), Maya Hawke (Stranger Things), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Lewis Black (Man of the Year), and Kensington Tallman (Drama Club).This is such a smart animated series with valuable lessons and real-life scenarios that resonate with everyone as they journey to adulthood. It cleverly illustrates how emotions evolve and how one's old and new selves adjust as responsibilities increase and life lessons are learned. The storyline is excellent. We saw this film in 3D, and the animation was stupendous. The hair and texture looked so realistic, you felt like you could reach out and touch them. There's so much to love in this animated gem.In conclusion, Inside Out 2 is another animated gem from Disney with smart coming-of-age elements that's worthwhile for the entire family.

And where in the first film, Riley must grapple with her entire known world collapsing beneath her - she now must grapple with going to a new high school without her middle school friends.The movie isn't exactly bad, but it feels cheaper in comparison. Even the lessons learned are important in this movie. Don't let anxiety control your brain.But isn't that what we learned from the first film? We saw Joy trying to be a control freak - and - what do you know - in this film, Anxiety turns into a control freak, causing a bunch of chaos for Riley.What's more, the new emotions seemed like lesser versions of the original emotions. Fear becomes Anxiety. Disgust becomes Envy. Sadness becomes Embarrassment and Ennui.It's just too bad that the first movie came out of seemingly nowhere and told a unique and loveable story with lessons for all ages, and in its sequel, we have a movie that feels half-baked and lacks as many whimsical/playful ideas as the first.The movie wasn't as fun or meaningful as the first.

The character of Riley Andersen entering her teenage stage and having it shown from the perspectives of her emotion characters does have some good depth alongside with good animation, colors, and voice performances from the cast members. Allowing some solid chemistry between the characters and dialogue.Personally, what causes the movie to struggle is it's emotional connection and dynamics at times, loses the same spark from it's previous movie. Sure, its original characters, humor, and colorful animation remains powerful and holding to its heights, however, because of some of the new characters I didn't connect with and certain concepts feeling thin, the strong emotional connection and atmospheres feel lost as if it floats around the mind aimlessly.Nevertheless, it does feel a relief where Disney actually puts some effort into making a solid movie after years of disappointments and disappointments.",

She is always trying to move on, act cooler and make new friends. As a Teenager, I can say this side to the story is very relatable. And it's what works about this story. Some teenager can relate, and that's why it's great, and Riley is a well written character throughout the first and second film.Riley also plays sports, and I enjoy the sport she likes. She plays Hockey, and tries her best to get into the team. Which all people try and do, another relatable side to the story. And I love how relatable it was throughout. After the disappointment of not being ready, she tries harder, and as a result of that it hurts the people she loves the most, as she's overly fixated on becoming a champ at Hockey. And she tries her best to prepare herself.The added characters felt a bit gimmicky at times, but I more or less enjoyed the new Characters. Especially Embarrasment, I always laughed when he was on. And he was a great character, as well as Anxiety. Who was the main side character in the story, who tries to set up Rileys future and fails.I love how are old characters are split up from the new, it creates some tension and drama. Whilst building up some character development for are new Characters. Which works well for both old and new. And the set up with Riley as a teenager is brilliant throughout too, she has some great moments in Hockey and with anger and dismissive attitude towards her mother. And that is also very accurate amongst teenager behaviour.I had a double date and we all gave our verdict, so I'll share them with you, Me:8/10, My Girlfriend 10/10, Her best Friend 9/10, Her Boyfriend 9/10, so overall I would recommend this film, especially if your a teenager.",

But really, everyone has these problems, no matter the age, so that makes it work, and the jokes are jolly good, some crazy humor runs through the film, despite the craziness of life nowadays.The action really does not stop much in this one, as the screen gets filled up by the colours of inside and outside life, perils and wonders, more peril than anything as the mind, sanity of poor old Riley gets well twisted up, again. It flies by at a good pace and feels other refreshing, which is hard, for most films at all, let alone a sequel. IMAX of this will be good if you can do it, quite sure the lungs of the actors were well and truly used up on this. Another five years for the next one, which must a theme of love, for sure.",

That honestly continues to hold true with how Star Wars Acolyte is going, but I'm not gonna go there right now.With that being said, Inside Out 2 is a pleasant surprise. I continue to be happy with Pixar, and as long as Disney keeps their trash to themselves, then good things happen, and Inside Out 2 is proof of that.Inside Out 2 is an entertaining, family-friendly fun sequel. While it isn't completely new, it does enough to keep it from being a repeat of the first film.Riley is growing up, and with that comes an array of new emotions and lessons for our old ones. I recall one of my biggest concerns for a Inside Out sequel was what else could be done or that it would just be a repeat of the first film with new emotions. I will say, for the most part, I was wrong.While the film does share a familiar structure of the first Inside Out this sequel in thanks to the new emotions, and new lessons for Riley and the emotions to learn, along with new jokes that can be made of Riley's teenage hood make it new enough.I appreciated the new emotions and how they would go on to grow Riley and also, in turn, continually humble Joy as well as the emotions learning they are all important to the maturing of this young girl.One of my favorite new aspects of this film which I did not see coming was introducing Rileys \"beliefs\" they did what I found to be a very intriguing visual representation of what I inferred to be Rileys soul but it could be also be inferred to be her subconscious either way it was well done.Inside Out 2 was far better than I had anticipated, and it was filled with laughs and feel good that Pixar knows how to deliver. I don't know if Pixar would do a third, but with how much I enjoyed this film, I would not say no.IMDb: 7/10\nLetterboxd: 3/5Watched in IMAX Theater.",

            "text": "LIKES:The AnimationThe Character DevelopmentThe Emotional DevelopmentBalance of Inside and OutCleverFunny At TimesCuteDecent PaceGreat Voice ActingUsed All The Characters Pretty EvenlySUMMARY:In terms of likes, Inside Out 2 is summarized as the usual Pixar magic with the modern-day approach of Disney's studio agenda. The animation is gorgeous with vivid colors, immaculate curves and angles, and fluid movements that are now an expectation for the studio to keep. It's eye-catching and stimulating, easily hypnotizing most of the younger members in my showing, but yet clever in design so that older fans can be entertained by the usual wit Pixar's cleverness brings. Both inside and outside of Riley keep to the themes, still being that cartoonish style for the humans, but somehow playing with light and shadow to add that flare that we love in a Disney production. It all plays a solid part in eliciting the emotions they are going for and is almost as much of a character as the literal characters themselves.As for the story and characters, this is where most of the movie is going to shine in my opinion. The second installment's story does a nice summary and introduction to the transitions in a fun montage, but quickly throws a wrecking ball into things that introduce the new emotions. From there, the movie becomes one part adventure and two parts emotion, in a delicate dance that is reflected in both inside and outside events to what I loved in the first film. Many of the emotions get some level of character development, alongside Riley who has complexity that is just as complicated as the age range the trailers have fixated on for the past few months. Yet, the emotional dive is the biggest development of the movie, with various scenarios coming that strummed the nostalgic strings of growing up and bombarded the relevant elements that added to the experience. It's a roller coaster that is deep and entertaining for viewers like me, moving at a decent pace that brings comedy, cleverness, storytelling, and cuteness into one vibrant package. The voice acting further adds to the mixture, sometimes being done to levels that had me envisioning the actors experiencing this pain as they delivered their lines to shockingly accurate degrees. All the emotions get shockingly balanced time, nine characters, plus Riley, actually having importance for inclusion and giving me adequate time with every emotion, which many studios fail to accomplish. All of this was very surprising to a degree given the amount of delays and controversy with this movie, but Mann's direction with her writers has made a story that is very relevant and somehow still holding some of the Pixar 90s-2000s adventure that for a while has been gone.DISLIKES:Less Creative World BuildingThe Antagonist Is More Metaphorical Than A ThreatMore Contributions By Some Characters Could Have Been DoneThe Adventure Is Okay, Yet Still MundaneThe RetconningRelevance Plays A Big KeySummary:\nWhere some of the cuts and costs of this balanced emotional tale come in the cost of the adventure and creative elements though. Maybe it's the teenage years and the metaphorical development that comes with growing older in some, but Inside Out's second ordeal didn't quite have the same creativity and unique flavor that the first did. The layout changes, but kind of in the laziest way possible with only a few moments being humorous more than wow. Even the antagonist and threat are less stellar than Joy's monster and Bing-Bong's shifting direction, as the new waves are again more a relevant force than a truly unique character. It leads to the adventure part being a bit blander and superficial, the excitement ebbed by very flash-in-the-pan moments and exaggerated jokes that fit well in the modern era. Some characters could have had more, Disgust needing to do more than just sound like a Valley Girl, or Fear maybe adding a little more protection or something, but that's a nitpicky component that ties back to other areas to get Riley through puberty. And true there are story misfires and changing an entire structure that is a bit farfetched to make the new belief system work, but they are easily overlooked in the long run. Perhaps the biggest thing I can warn, is that relevance and relatability may be more of a motivating factor for people to enjoy this movie that might sway the review scores one way or another.The VERDICT:\nInside Out 2 is a movie that has been timed beautifully given the current timing of the year and the lack of animation movies for at least the next three weeks. Much like the first movie, it hits hard in both emotional/poetic glory with the same fun adventure that Pixar proves it still has despite a focus on realistic stories. I loved the balance to many degrees, and because of my own relevance with these emotions and characters had extra levels that enhanced my viewing experience. With a great blend of acting, design, animation, and storytelling, despite not paying attention or explaining some key factors being changed, the movie does accomplish much for the targeted audience group and the supporting group around them. True, the adventure lacks some of the originality, cleverness, and obstacles that add spice to a movie that I enjoy and want Pixar to return to. However, the movie was worth a theater visit, with only the animation style's colors being the 3-D nature of the movie. I'd check this one out if you can get a chance, but also I won't call this the best sequel or Pixar movie ever.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",

            "text": "Pixar's much-anticipated follow-up to the mind-bending original, Inside Out 2, dives back into the chaotic headquarters of Riley's emotions, this time as she tackles the turbulent terrain of adolescence.The film tackles a relevant and relatable theme-the pressure to be perfect that plagues many teens. We see Anxiety slowly hijacking Riley's console, her need for control turning into a relentless pursuit of good grades, social status, and the approval of her impossibly cool classmate, Val. While the exploration of teenage anxiety is commendable, the plot itself feels a bit predictable. We've seen the \"overachieving teen\" trope before, and the resolution, while heartwarming, feels a touch formulaic.Where Inside Out 2 shines is in its visual storytelling. The animation is, as expected from Pixar, stunning. The introduction of new \"emotion landscapes,\" like the Sar-Chasm that fuels Riley's contemptuous side, and the jungle that represents her unconscious, are imaginative and visually dazzling. The use of colour is particularly effective, with Anxiety's world rendered in a sterile, monochromatic palette that beautifully reflects her controlling nature. The voice acting remains strong, with Poehler and Black perfectly capturing Joy and Anger's signature traits. Hawke, as the newcomer Anxiety, delivers a high-strung performance that's both comical and relatable.However, some of the new characters, like Ennui, feel a bit underdeveloped. Their personalities aren't fleshed out as fully as the originals, leaving them as one-note additions to the emotional spectrum. The film's pacing also falters at times, particularly in the second act, where the focus on Riley's anxieties starts to feel repetitive.Inside Out 2 is a film with good intentions. It tackles a complex issue with a fair amount of humour and heart. But it doesn't quite recapture the magic of the original. The predictable plot and underdeveloped new characters hold it back from greatness. Still, the beautiful animation, strong voice acting, and relatable themes make it a worthwhile watch, particularly for parents with teenagers navigating the emotional rollercoaster of adolescence.So, is it a must-see? Not necessarily. But it's a decent popcorn flick with a message about the importance of embracing all of our emotions, even the messy ones. And hey, that's something we can all agree on, right?",

Embarrassment could have just been a part of disgust. And Ennui? That's not really even an emotion. How about, I don't know, love?I felt like there was no direction at all.

            "text": "\"Inside Out 2\" is the sequel to Pixar's 2015 film \"Inside Out\". Directed and co-written by Kelsey Mann and featuring the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, and Maya Hawke, it is a worthy follow-up that might just be the best Pixar sequel that is not related to the \"Toy Story\" series.One year after the events of the first film, Riley Andersen (voiced by Kensington Tallman) has just turned 13 and is ready to start high school. Once again guiding Riley on her journey are her emotions Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (voiced by Tony Hale), and Disgust (voiced by Liza Lapira). When Riley ventures off to ice hockey camp with her best friends, her five emotions try to work together to ensure she is able to make a good first impression by removing her negative memories and sending them to the back of her mind. To her shock, Riley soon learns that her friends will be attending different high schools and her emotions are unable to help her react to this in the usual clear manner. Complicating matters further, Riley also gains four new emotions in the process - Anxiety (voiced by Maya Hawke), Envy (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (voiced by Paul Walter Hauser), and Ennui (voiced by Adele Exarchopoulos).Back in 2015, Pixar released what myself and many others consider to be one of their very best films - \"Inside Out\". This landmark movie, which focuses on the personified emotions of a young girl named Riley, successfully appealed to viewers from all walks of life thanks to the clever way it tackles deep and important themes that virtually anyone can relate to regardless of their age. As a result, the film has deservedly cemented itself among not only Pixar's crowning achievements but also as quite possibly one of the greatest animated films of all time. Unlike many other Pixar films, I've always thought that this one had the most amount of sequel potential due to the character of Riley growing older and her emotions needing to assist her with even more of life's problems. Nine years later, we now have \"Inside Out 2\", a follow-up that covers the complexity of early adolescence and the obstacles we are all bound to face along the way.As to be expected, this film does away with Riley's naive, child-like view of the world in favour of her adopting a more mature outlook as a teenager. We see how her five emotions, led by the perpetually optimistic Joy, have learned to work in harmony with each other to ensure that Riley has the most enjoyable experience possible in this new period of her life. While things seem to be fine for everyone at first, certain situations start to arise that cause many issues for the five emotions, such as how the quintet are unable to decipher the sarcastic facial expressions of Riley's friends. In an effort to correct issues like this, Joy has all negative memories like this launched into the back of Riley's mind as a form of suppression, which seems to work until one night. This is when the emotions notice a large alarm labelled \"Puberty\" flashing brightly, and despite their best efforts to rid themselves of this warning signal, they soon realise that things can only worse from here on out.We are then introduced to four brand new emotions who suddenly show up out of the blue. Anxiety, who nervously tries to control any situation, Envy, who covets everyone's best features, Embarrassment, who regularly makes a fool of himself, and Ennui, an apathetic emotion who would rather stare at her phone than interact with others. Though these new additions to Riley's emotional state are welcomed by the other five, it becomes clear that this place has little room for so many emotions working at the same time. Believing the original five are now no longer needed, Anxiety has them placed inside a glass bottle and stored away to allow her to take control of Riley's new teenage mindset. With this new power at her fingertips, Anxiety starts to create negative memories out of nothing, which causes havoc on Riley's self esteem. What we see here is the emergence of something most teenagers can relate to - a paranoid, distorted world view that changes the way they see themselves. In poor Riley's case, she starts viewing herself as an outcast loser.The film does a solid job showing all of the resulting awkwardness that Riley faces with her new emotions at the helm. She constantly assumes the worst in everything, she craves becoming a great hockey player like her heroes, she clumsily tries to look cool in front of others, and she cannot find the motivation to overcome her problems in a constructive manner. Without her original five emotions around to help her, Riley loses sight of who she truly is, becoming an insecure shell of her former self. For the majority of the story, we watch as Joy and the other four original emotions journey back to headquarters to stop their successors from corrupting Riley further, finding creative ways to sneak their influence in to fix any damage they have caused. Like the previous film, this one cleverly uses Riley's emotional state to show us how we all must find the right methods to cope with the obstacles we face in life to grow into a better person.In addition to this, the film also looks as fantastic as ever, something that should go without saying in a Pixar movie. In one scene, we see a dark and mysterious location known as the \"Sense of Self\", where all of Riley's core memories are stored through string-like strands that play quotes that resonate through Riley's mind to remind her of the type of person she is at heart. When Anxiety takes over, she corrupts some of these memories in the form of a small tree, which grows larger as Riley makes more mistakes over time. It's interesting to see how each of these places change once the new emotions have seized control, and the film gives us glimpses of what they were once like with the original five in charge.All of these new emotions means more characters than before, which is unfortunately one of the film's most obvious weaknesses. With a total of nine emotions now inside Riley's head, it feels like the film is struggling to juggle so many different characters within the story at the same time but only managing to pull it off sparingly. The only new emotion that is given the most spotlight is Anxiety, and although this makes sense within the context of the story, it does not allow for the other three to be featured nearly as enough. I was hoping to see more of the dynamic between Anxiety and her other three compadres, yet this only really happens at about two crucial moments in the film. Still, there was one scene near the end that utilises everyone reasonably well, even if it did take a long time to reach that point in the story.The film's voice acting is a strong as ever, with Amy Poehler injecting that much needed positive relief into Joy. Like Riley, Joy appears to have grown considerably since the previous film, changing from a blind optimist to a sensible pragmatist. She now understands the value of teamwork, often seeking advice from her fellow emotions whenever she can't figure out how to make Riley react in certain situations. As a result, this film feels more like a team effort rather than a solo adventure, with Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust contributing significantly to both Joy and Riley's growth as characters. I really liked watching the way Poehler portrays Joy's collaborative personality throughout the film, and her respective chemistry with Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Tony Hale, and Liza Lapira really gives the impression that these emotions are a tight-knit group.As mentioned earlier, it is Anxiety that the film chooses to focus on the most out of the four new emotions. Maya Hawke is great at showing the character's intense neuroticism coupled with her desire to maintain her own twisted sense of control over Riley's life. She can be considered the antithesis to Joy's level-headed, confident nature, projecting all of her insecurities into Riley's personality. I just wish Anxiety interacted more with Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui, whose voice talents in Ayo Edebiri, Paul Walter Hauser, and Adele Exarchopoulos felt somewhat wasted by the time the film had finished.For a sequel to a highly regarded original, \"Inside Out 2\" may not quite live up to the level of its predecessor, but it is nonetheless a satisfying continuation of a story about someone's emotional journey through life. Without revealing spoilers, its end moral is equally as impactful as the original and is sure to strike a chord with just as many adults as it will with children. It seems the next logical step that a third film should cover Riley and her emotions during her late teens to early adult years, although this may prove challenging to remain family friendly. Regardless, I'm still curious to see what happens from here.I rate it 8/10.",

So if this wasn't a prequel, what are we doing here?? There were multiple plot points that were seemingly important that went nowhere... including an inhaler, dietary restrictions, a friends vacation and some strung up poultry.I'm just confused and disappointed as to why they simply remade this movie with even less of a storyline, not as good actors and a lame ending... all without infusing anything new, interesting or original into it.

Unfortunately for them, three masked strangers are about to make their night a living hell.To be clear, some may consider this review biased as I count myself as a major fan of Bryan Bertino's original 2008 film \"The Strangers\". To date, it is possibly the most nerve-shredding experience I've had seeing a film on the big screen. Sixteen years have passed since I first saw it, but I've never forgotten it. And while its 2018 sequel, \"The Strangers: Prey at Night\" took a notably different tone, it at least managed to function as a stylish and energetic slasher film in the same vein.This reboot (or prequel, according to some sources--having seen the film now, I am unsure of how this could possibly function as such) does no such thing. Rather, it follows the framework of the 2008 original nearly beat by beat, save a protracted first quarter in which we are served the \"city kids in redneck town full of leery locals who are sinister for no apparent reason\" trope (by the way, I am a native Oregonian, and I can vouch that people there do not speak with southern accents, even in the backwoods).The things that \"The Strangers: Chapter 1\" gets wrong are numerous, but the subtlety, stillness, and down-home feel of its source material is one of the glaring things that is most sorely missed. This film is loaded with dramatic musical cues, predictable scares, fog machine-shrouded forests, and trite dialogue. There is little to no gravity to be found here in the characters or the setting, and without that, a film with a barebones story like this swiftly goes off the rails into the land of cliche after cliche after cliche. The lead actors here do what they can with the material, but the stilted dialogue often renders them at the mercy of a lifeless and clunky script.In the end, \"The Strangers: Chapter 1\" simply feels like a soulless paint-by-numbers imitation of the 2008 film, using the template as a vessel only to fill it with bland, uninspired recreations of that film's most tense and frightening moments. There are no scares to be had here, and even worse, there are few thrills either. \"The Strangers: Chapter 1\" is frankly boring, which does not bode well for a further two installments. \"To be continued\"? No, thank you. 2/10.",

OK, maybe if you're 12 and have never seen any of the myriad of movies with THE SAME PLOT, you may be intrigued.There were plenty of failed attempts at suspense. The problem is there's no reason to care at all what happens to this couple. And what's with the girl's lips? Was she stung by a bee?An example of the brilliant dialog comes when they try to leave the restaurant and the car won't start. \"What's the matter?\" she asks. \"The car won't start\" he answers.Then later, the couple tries to hide from the bad guys by running through the same woods calling out for each other and using the speakerphone.If this were A Quiet Place, they wouldn't last long.",

            "text": "The Strangers: Chapter 1' embarks on a journey to rekindle the chilling essence of its predecessor, yet it stumbles into the abyss of the overexploited home-invasion genre. Directed by Renny Harlin, the film attempts to lay the groundwork for a new prequel trilogy but does so with a palpable lack of originality and an overreliance on worn-out tropes. The narrative follows Maya and Ryan, portrayed by Madelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez, whose road trip takes a detour into terror. Stranded in a remote Airbnb, they become the prey of the franchise's notorious masked antagonists. While the setting is ripe for tension and fear, the execution falls short, with the film succumbing to predictable jump scares and a script that lacks the subtlety required for a truly harrowing experience. The performances, while earnest, are hindered by characters that are crafted more as archetypes than as fleshed-out individuals, leading to decisions that serve plot convenience over logical storytelling. The antagonists, once symbols of random and unfathomable violence, are now reduced to mere shadows of their former selves, lacking the enigmatic terror that once haunted viewers. In its endeavor to pay homage to the original, 'The Strangers: Chapter 1' instead echoes its scenes and dialogues without capturing the same suspenseful atmosphere. It's a cinematic paradox; a film that is both a retread and a step backward, leaving audiences with a sense of déjà vu rather than dread. In conclusion, 'The Strangers: Chapter 1 is a reminder that many efforts of success is to revive a franchise that perhaps should have been left undisturbed. It serves as a reminder that not all chapters are worth revisiting, but especially when the story has nothing new to say. Chapter 2 here it comes...",

The road trip seems like a good start, but kissing while driving on a curved road is a bit stupid, though forgivable. Now, the people in the diner are weird and basically put me off if they behave like that. They look like a decent couple, and even what they are wearing is very respectable. Now, it happens when the car, etc., etc., and they end up in the cabin. Now, someone knocking in the middle of nowhere is very suspicious, and yet they open the door as normal. Not checking who it was, and without a light-that's super, super daft for me. Secondly, she said it's so quiet and she can't hear anything, like a car, etc. Yet, she can't hear the following: someone walking inside the house, someone watching while she's taking a shower, and playing the piano. She runs to the second floor to hide when she sees a person with a mask. She said it was so quiet earlier, but now she didn't even hear her boyfriend come back when, in fact, the motorcycle (a big bike) and the cabin are big, but you can hear if a motorcycle arrives. You can definitely hear when he arrives. She hears the footsteps of her boyfriend, yet she doesn't hear the so-called stranger. They are so quick in disappearing, so I don't know if they are human or monsters (is it a slasher film or fantasy/horror?). But I can't find the answer because I've decided not to waste my time anymore. I don't even care if parts 2 or 3 are coming out.

A remote cabin fully equipped with all the home comforts - even some Dolly to play on vinyl. They're famished so he borrows a motor bike to go fetch some burgers, she's left behind and that's where the paranoia sets in. Is she being watched? Is she alone? Will \"Ryan\" get back before she has finished smoking a dodgy joint, listening to an entire LP and having a long shower? Was the burger joint in California? Anyway, it's soon clear that they are in some danger and together they must use all their skill and guile to stay alive! The scenario works a bit like \"Cabin in the Woods\".

It's basically the same as the original strsngers movie though, so from what I've read they made 3 new strangers movies all at once, this will involve a spoiler so stop reading if you don't want to know the endingSo the story is much like so many other horror movies, young couple decide to take some weird exit to place in middle of no where. People there are pretty weird towards them, their new car mysteriously stops working looks like the local\nmechanic sabotaged it to get the work and make some money. So they are stuck for the night and manage to get an air bnb like cabin off the internet amazing they even gave connection out there mind you! They go to the cabin and not long after they get a loud knock at the door with what sounds like a little girl outside asking if her friend is home. The guy decides to leave his partner in this scary cabin and go get his asthma pump he left in their car and get some food meanwhile the strangers somehow get into the cabin with the gf. The rest of the movie the couple are hiding and trying to evade the three weirdos dead set on killing them. The guy manages to find a shotgun with plenty of ammo in the shed yet he manages to shoot the wrong guy and kills some innocent man. They end up losing to the weirdos and tied up in two chairs where the strangers stab the couple one by one. Really horrible unsatisfying way to end the movie however we see the girl is in hospital at the end and apparently doesn't die! So at least the next chapter might be some good revenge movie hopefully!So the main actress in this movie was making the second movie in the afternoon and this movie in the morning I read which is crazy! Never heard of this before! And as you can tell if she's in the next chapter she survives right!What I found very frustrating was how the boyfriend somehow found a shot gun and lots of ammo and they end up losing to a knife and a axe!The movie captured the same helplessness as the first movie the acting was very good I thought and the main female lead she was very convincing as being scared out of her brains by these weirdos in her house trying to kill her.If you liked the first one you most likely won't like this as it's the same story but just not as good but I think it's a really good horror movie in its own right however very frustrating as most horrors are like how the strangers some how just missed the cops at the very end and how the shotgun didn't win a knife fight! I'm not sure why they had to make three new strangers movies though? So that will be five stranger movies in total!!!If you haven't seen the original definitely give it a go and it's gonna be interesting where they go with the next chapter hopefuly the chick will have some crazy revenge going on with the local weirdo hicks!",

The runtime is 1 hour & 24 minutes & has lightening quick pacing! So, that was also a plus!Overall, it's a decent film! You'll like this one if you liked the first 2 films! Can't wait for Chapters' 2 & 3!7/10.",

Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face. The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter. No humor either. It all leads to a truly harrowing ending. There was supposed to be a happy ending but they (wisely) chose not to do it. Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances. I even thought Paltrow (who I hate) was good! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role.If you have trouble with blood, gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie. But if you can handle that, watch this one. It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting.",

            "text": "The movie, \"Se7en\", starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow, is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichés. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \"The Divine Comedy\", sets out to, \"preach\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays.Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date.Score 10/10",

            "text": "It is a rarity for a film to be completely unsettling and yet unrelentingly gripping.David Fincher's story takes place in a bleak and constantly raining city (never named) where urban decay and sleaze in all forms are rampant. Coming up to his retirement from the police force is Detective Lieutenant Somerset (Morgan Freeman) who is tasked with breaking in his replacement, Detective Sergeant Mills (Brad Pitt) before leaving. Somerset is world weary, under no illusions about the futility of the daily role he plays and (initially) wants nothing more than to escape the grime and violence of the city. Mills on the other hand is convinced that he is going to make a real difference having voluntarily transferred to this precinct, bringing his wife to the city with him. Before Somerset can move on, a homicide comes in which he and Mills are assigned to investigate. But its only the first of a string of ritual murders that will be committed by a killer who is basing his crimes on the seven deadly sins as depicted in Dante's \"The divine comedy\".To begin with, Se7en appears to be a standard \"cops on the trail of a killer\" story which shouldn't be too difficult for the audience to get comfortable with. But as we descend along with the characters into the merciless, brutal world without hope that they inhabit, you are left reeling at the events that unfold.The two detectives enjoy an uneasy relationship with no real friendship ever striking up between them. The older Somerset is educated, astute and gives the impression of being emotionally burnt out. Mills, who has no respect for Somersets methodical investigating gets excited at the thought of solving a murder and firmly believes that the good guys will win eventually. The further we get into the action, the might of the evil that they face pushes both men beyond their limits.This film draws heavily on biblical themes and you can certainly see similarities with such films as \"The Seventh Seal\" (1957). Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.Se7en shows us a world which has been destroyed by its own sins, a wasteland in which values are minimal. The killer, having nothing but contempt for this world, sees it as his mission to expose the faults and show everyone what they have become. It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him. This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same point.A previous reviewer mentioned that you begin to expect the unexpected whilst watching Se7en and i completely agree. Eventually if you think of the most obvious outcome in any situation and predict that the opposite will happen, it usually does. Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope. This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.Director David Fincher didn't pick up another script for 18 months, such was his exhaustion and frustration following the completion of Alien 3. Apparently he agreed to direct se7en after one reading of Andrew Kevin Walkers screenplay because he was drawn to its hard hitting delivery about inhumanity. He stated: \"It's psychologically violent. It implies so much, not about why you did but how you did it\". For the camera work specially altered film stock was used to make the visuals look as dark and unsettling as possible which is complemented well by Howard Shores music score.The Most disturbing message that Se7en puts across, is that the fight against evil is destined to be a Pyrrhic victory. But regardless the only thing we can do is fight on whatever the cost. We have no other choice.\"The World is a fine place and worth fighting for.\" I agree with the second part.",

What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering. There is also an intelligent screenplay, a clever plot telling of a vicious serial killer who murders his victims in a gruesome way to atone for the sins(gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath)he deems them to have committed and excellent direction. The acting is also superb, Morgan Freeman gives another brilliant performance as the disillusioned detective and Brad Pitt is great as Mills in a more meatier role than he has ever done. Gwyneth Paltrow makes a small yet significant appearance as Mill's uneasy wife, while Kevin Spacey superbly delivers equally superb dialogue as John Doe despite the fact he isn't in the film much. Overall, a brilliant film, with adept performances, direction, style and ambition. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "text": "After his calamitous experience working on his début film Alien 3 (1992), David Fincher took on a small genre picture that, little did he know, would revitalise his career and become one of the greatest films of the 1990's. Se7en appears to begin as your typical detective neo- noir, with the cynical veteran and the naive rookie taking on an elusive serial killer seemed hell-bent on turning the sin against the sinner. But, set in an unnamed and permanently drizzly American city, Se7en is a meditation on evil and a pessimist's depiction on the modern world, climaxing in one of the bravest and most memorable endings in Hollywood history.Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is on the verge of retirement, where he plans to leave his inner-city life behind him after years of fighting on the side of good. His replacement is the brash Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), an optimistic young recruit eager to learn, who Somerset takes under his wing. Their first homicide investigation involves an obese man who has been fed at gunpoint to the point of causing his stomach to rupture. With Somerset ready to leave the force, Mills takes on his first solo case in the murder of a rich attorney, a man forced to cut a pound of flesh from his own body. The murder scene has the words 'greed' written in blood. Somerset eventually finds the word 'gluttony' etched in grease in the apartment of the first victim, and he becomes convinced the murders are connected, and that the killer is murdering under the guidance of the seven deadly sins.The genius of Se7en is rooted in the way the movie keeps the audience as clueless as the detectives. Normally in genre pictures such as this, we either know who the killer is and eagerly wait for the investigators to put the pieces together, or we have a line-up of suspects and red herrings to decide from. Here, apart from brief glimpses during a thrilling chase scene, we are devoid of clues. The killer is always one step ahead of Somerset and Mills, alluding to the idea that the mysterious 'John Doe' is indeed having his work guided by a higher power. Of course, he is not, he is merely a man, but this helps gives Se7en dramatic weight, rather than it becoming a nihilistic exercise in cruelty.When, three-quarters of the movie in, the killer hands himself in, the movie becomes a masterclass in writing, slowly building into one of the greatest climaxes in film. Somerset, a decent man who has devoted his life to the side of good but has had the fight slowly drained out of him, meets his nemesis in John Doe (Kevin Spacey). But as they talk, Doe's reasoning becomes clear and, shockingly, almost sympathetic. \"Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer,\" he says. It's about a world gone to s**t, a view shared by Mills' wife Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who talks to Somerset in a diner about allowing a baby to be born into the world after discovering she is pregnant. Cerebral and Gothic, Se7en transcends the genre on so many levels thanks to some bleak yet stylish direction by Fincher, and it still manages to astound after almost 20 years of repeat viewings.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

It is art captured on film. This movie is a bright spot for all of the stars who worked on it. Brad Pitt never gets the credit he deserves for his acting because he's a pretty boy and the press is a lot more interested about how he and Jennifer are doing. That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays. That is quite rare in the A-list world. Morgan Freeman is a great actor. You can always count on him to do what he does best which is play a wise veteran that has seen it all. Kevin Spacey is another great actor that has great range and really puts life and personality into his characters.\nThe real talent of this movie, excluding the actors that brought it to life, is the director David Fincher and the writer Andrew Kevin Walker. Fincher's talents for making a visually stunning film are now well known and he often brings a dark patina to his work. Andrew Kevin Walker must have some incredible demons living inside him. Either that or one hell of an imagination for bringing the intricate story of Seven and the plan of John Doe to life. John Doe's plan really is twisted and I won't be spoiling it here. Suffice to say I have never seen so evil and complicated a plan in a movie before or since. The cinematography of the film is dark but beautiful and throughout the film it is either night or raining or both except for two very brief moments. It is such an emotional movie that you can't keep from being caught up in what is happening. Do you understand and sympathize with what John Doe is doing or do you think him a mad killer that must be stopped.Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it. It is so damn good that I know you will like it. The only reason you wouldn't is because you're just too damn fragile to take something this hardcore.",

            "text": "Seldom does a film elucidate the culpability of our culture,of our society, in the mayhem and madness we often find in everyday life. According to Se7en, our culture is drifting through darkness. The mouthpiece for this thematic undercurrent is Somerset, a literate man who also happens to be a detective, a man who can read a clue (\"This isn't going to be a happy ending\") or Dante's Inferno with equal aplomb. He even provides the film's final thematic statement with a quote from Hemingway. His quirkiness, perhaps the outgrowth of a brilliant mind, is no worse than that of any prophet or seer of old, those harbingers of Biblical insight whom others always find kooky and offbeat. He is not well loved for his cynical, pessimistic outlook (such that his consuming motivation is to retire and get out of town). However, by the end it becomes clear that it is Somerset who sees our dark world with the prophet's particular clarity. (It is left to his partner Mills to find this out the hard way).Working on us to reinforce this world as Somerset sees it is the film's astounding mise-en-scene, a disturbing film-noir setting developed by director David Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Flashlights barely illuminate the slimy walls of the roach-infested tenement of one victim and the dark bedroom of another. Rain pours down in buckets. Bird's-eye-view shots of downtown (the city is never named- a generic, everyman's kind of place) show dingy, sooty rooftops and grimy streets. Only the film's closing scene is in bright sunlight, which by then only serves as ironic counterpoint to what we see happening.This is Somerset's vision; both inhabited and described by him. He finds a surprising fellow traveler in, not his partner, but the elusive killer John Doe. Doe shares the vision and provides an unsettling echo to the rumblings and teachings of Somerset. If one looks at life through the Somerset lens, one must admit that John Doe has a valid point. He and Somerset have arrived at the same conclusion, the difference between them being how they have responded. (Somerset longs to escape to some otherworldly realm in the country. Doe has taken action.)Though gripping and fast moving, this is not an action film. It holds our interest through the workings of horror and mystery: a stark, film-noir detective piece. Except for one tense pursuit through halls and alleys in pouring rain, as well as the bit of ending action, there is surprisingly little violence. We see each murder, save two, after the fact, as a crime scene. This only makes the final act that much more suspenseful.This is a very tight film. Elements within: dialogue, actions, lighting, setting, all of these tend to reinforce one another to paint a solid picture. It is a perverse logic that makes the final and seventh sin complete perfectly the circle of events begun with the first.",

I even see this movie more as an horror movie than as a  thriller because of that.  \"Se7en\" is unique in many ways. The movies mood is already set right  from the beginning on. The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and  mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie. It's  very depressing to watch and I mean that in a positive way of the  meaning of the word. The mood is set by good camera work and lighting,  or better said, the lack of it. The music from acclaimed composer  Howard Shore also adds to the chilling atmosphere.  Unlike many other movies from the same genre, the movie is slow paced  and takes it time to develop the characters without falling into some  obvious cliché's. The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and  Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different  in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them  such a great couple. Brad Pitt for once has the opportunity to play  more than just the pretty boy and he does it with success. Kevin Spacey  truly plays a bone chilling character, almost just as legendary and  chilling as Hannibal Lecter. I would very much like to see the two of  them put in the same room, just to see who would make it out alive.  Further more it was great to see R. Lee Emrey again as the police  captain.  The movie is filled with some truly gross, sickening and horrifying  scene's, this seriously ain't no kids stuff! The movie has some of the  most sickening murders I have ever seen featured in a movie. But it  aren't just only the gross scene's that are good, there are also some  scene's that are made with lot's of beauty and profession such as the  library scene.

This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins. Both actors displayed striking performances that are so sharp and realistic sometimes you have to remind yourself that's its all acting. David Fincher's masterpiece really gives us an opportunity of a lifetime, maybe it's one that we don't all wish to share, but by seeing this movie you will experience a glimpse of the horrors that this world is filled with, and a small piece of mind of a man who you only prey you never have to meet.Brad Pitt successfully proves to us that he's not just a pretty face on screen, and that he sinks into his character so well, that you can walk off after the film finishes classifying him as a pretty darn good actor.You wouldn't expect anything else from Morgan Freeman because it's perfectly obvious that this guy was born to play the roles of the smart detective.David Fincher's timeless directing and memorable filming captures all the goods that this film has to offer and will undoubtedly leave you shocked and begging for more films like this. Seven is a step into the harsh realities of life, a realistic portrayal of two detectives investigation into the un-describable horrific world murder, and the darkest realms of the human soul.We can only prey for more classic memorable work from Mr. Fincher and for those future directors who are intent on making a gothic, psychological thriller, make sure you sit down and watch Seven with a pen and paper ready to take notes.",

Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.An unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.Having been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it's an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it's psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don't want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\"But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever\"Seven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman's weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It's going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that's when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there's the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!Faultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to \"light\" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10",

Perhaps I've become jaded, but I found nothing here that was particularly scary or mind-bending. A clever nut-job leads the police on a mad chase, punishing people as \"sinners\". The only difference between this and a half-dozen other serial killer movies is the theme of the killings and the fact that the killer turns himself in 3/4's of the way into the story.This leads to the \"twist\" ending that seems to remain with so many people. I didn't find the \"twist\" horrific, though. I simply found it jarring. It didn't fit and it didn't particularly surprise me either. Once the killer decided to let Mills live, you knew he was going to mess with him somehow. The only surprise is the degree of what he did. As far as I'm concerned, they could have dispensed with the whole \"wrath\" setup and ended with John Doe's words to Mills - \"You're only sitting here because I ALLOWED you to live and you'll know that every time you look in the mirror.\"Instead, they had to go for a \"shocker\" ending. This is the \"twist\" ending that supposedly makes the movie.Here's the thing, though - The ending doesn't fit the killer's MO. We're given every reason to believe that John Doe is clever, capable, and highly intelligent. He's on a mission. He believes in his mission. He punishes the guilty for their sins, not the innocent. Why, then, does he pick a completely innocent stranger and use her as a vehicle to brand himself as personification of Envy? If he really was envious of Mills (a fact that is highly doubtful), he was already deserving of punishment so why kill an innocent person to make the point? How does the manipulation of Mills into becoming Wrath actually punish Mills for having committed the sin of Wrath?None of these things make any logical sense within the framework of the story. The ending is completely out of synch with everything we've learned about the killer, including his own statements. All you can do is shrug your shoulders and say \"Well, you can't expect an insane killer to be logical.\" and that just doesn't sit right with me. Not after the buildup we were given concerning John Doe.I can't recommend this movie. If you want to see a taut, disturbing film in this style (sans the insane serial killer) then rent \"8 Millimeter\" instead.",

            "text": "Se7En Se7en is just one of those movies that burrows deep under your skin and festers. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker have created a bleak, desolate world where there are no real heroes, only sinners. An uncompromising story, filthy, grainy visuals and terrific performances make Se7en a modern classic. Det. William Sommerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen the human spirit at its worst throughout his 34 years of police service. He finally realises he has had enough of the horrors of the world and he becomes ready for retirement. David Mills (Brad Pitt) is a brash, hot-headed rookie cop who believes his big break lies in the murky, seedy unnamed metropolis. Amidst some cynicism, Sommerset takes on Mills as a partner for his last days. When two murders occur within two days of each other the duo realize that a serial killer is murdering his victims in accordance with the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. What follows is a terrifying and disturbing story of the dark side of human nature. Fincher's Noir York with endless rain, rain that fails to wash (to quote Travis Bickle) the filth off the streets, is a harsh look into urban life where decency is a rarity. Along with his cinematographer Darius Khondji, paints the screen with dark greys, blacks and yellow to hint at the rotting core of this environment. Freeman gives the film its most complex performance and moral core. His detective has grown weary of apathy and he slightly suggests an understanding of the despicable killer. On that note, Kevin Spacey delivers a chilling portrayal, a killer with a blankly human face and disturbing conviction. Writer Walker has written a cop-genre film with impeccable substance. Rather than a whodunit or an action movie, he has given birth to a story that pokes and prods at our psychic. It forces us to confront ourselves and question the next time we eat too much, or take too much time gelling our hair or even lash out in road rage. He questions our day-by-day apathy and ignorance to the savagery of human existence in a time of war, poverty, cynicism and most importantly sin.",

Mills gladly takes over the case and plunges himself in way over his head.As the work of a Crimally insane genius continues, Mills grows more and more erratic, and Somerset simply has to remain, to guide his young partner through the case, which ultimately leads to one of the finest climax's in movie history.With Wonderful Performances from both Freeman and Pitt and a really dark and morbid direction from David Fincher, the movie is crammed with suspense, intrigue and Excitement.My Favourite scene is John Doe (Kevin Spacey) tearing into Mills in the car, driving towards the Climax, the acting is simply perfect as Pitt's character is torn apart by the genius of the Criminally insane, and Freeman interjects with insightful rationality, demonstrating his superior mind. The Scene Carries such intensity, and at the same time encapsulates the primary characters basic elements.

Pitt was still on the upswing of his career, \"Gwyn\" was still not yet a household name (which was a good thing for this role), and of course Freeman was at the top of his game (see SHAWSHANK, UNFORGIVEN, OUTBREAK, etc.) once again playing the voice of reason to perfection. And throw in Spacey, who was still in the last stages of being a THAT GUY (albeit, one of the very best THAT GUYS-- he would pick up a Supporting Actor Oscar the next year for THE USUAL SUSPECTS), and you've got one helluva cast.But it wouldn't have all mattered if the story wasn't any good, and this one, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, is top notch. I guess my only real beef is that we wait too long until we actually get involved visually with Spacey's John Doe. But once he shows, the movie is even more riveting down the stretch. The chase scene and then finally the car ride scene are tremendous, as is the final showdown which I won't spoil here but I think every movie buff is familiar with by now.WATCH IT AGAIN WHEN YOU CAN!",

The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to \"expect the unexpected\" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",

            "text": "Se7en is a very complex and deep movie, while also being quite disturbing. Andrew Kevin Walker created one of the most original spec screenplays of all time, but it is the kind of story traditionally used more as a writing sample than actually made into a movie. But the creative team of director David Fincher believed in this extremely dark, uncompromising story, and made it just the way Walker wrote it.The story revolves around two extremely well-drawn characters, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and William Somerset (Morgan Freeman). In one sense their relationship is the ultimate cliché -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though Mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place). But the contrast between these two characters is played out not for laughs or cheap drama but as the real working out of a moral question. Somerset, the lonely, cynical older detective, cares about people but has seen too much of the dark side of life to have much hope for society. Mills is not as intelligent as Somerset (kudos to Pitt for being willing to play a character that frequently looks foolish), and he lives by a simplistic belief in the power of law enforcement to change the world.Throughout the movie, the two characters struggle with this conflict -- is human society basically rotten, and can one person do anything to make a difference? Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is. Mills is the kind of person who has never truly questioned the simple \"values\" he was raised with. Somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails.In the end, it is only John Doe, the serial killer, who can teach Mills (and by extension the audience) the truth -- that this world is very often shockingly vicious and senselessly cruel. Doe and Somerset actually have similar views of society and the world, up to a point. But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.This movie is about the investigation Mills and Somerset undertake of Doe's murders, his \"sermon\" to the world through serial killing. Ultimately, Mills and Somerset can only do so much to try to stop Doe; the killer always seems at least one step ahead of them, and stays that way until the very end of the movie. In a normal Hollywood film, Mills and Somerset would \"win\" in the end by catching Doe and setting the world right again. But Andy Walker had a quite different ending in mind, and Fincher and his team take the shocking conclusion all the way to the limit of tension and drama.This movie, like Fincher's \"Fight Club,\" was controversial for being violent and gruesome. Certainly there are a number of gruesome and disturbing images of murder victims' bodies, and many aspects of the story are very troubling, to say the least. But only one person is shown being killed on screen, and by far the worst of what happens in this story happens in the viewer's imagination. Unlike most films that have high levels of violence -- including, for example, Reservoir Dogs or Silence of the Lambs -- this movie genuinely attempts to grapple with the moral implications of what is being shown on screen. In direct contrast with, say Quentin Tarantino, who uses extreme violence for shock effect and to gain notoriety, Fincher actually shows less violence on screen and raises far more probing moral questions in the viewer's mind. I cannot think of any movie that contains as much genuine debate and discussion among the characters about crime and human morality as this one does -- while never becoming dull or preachy for a moment.I cannot finish this review without a word about Mr. Fincher's extraordinary visual talents. This is a man who ranks with the top handful of directors of all time in his knowledge and grasp of film-making technique. Everything from set design to lighting, selection of film stock and processing techniques, camera movement, frame composition, and editing work together to create an entirely new level of visual brilliance. Fincher's use of technique brings to mind nothing more than the work of Steven Spielberg in the 1970s, the last time a director this extraordinary burst onto the Hollywood scene. A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties. Fincher uses every one of these tools to their utmost. The technical work and supporting actors are uniformly superb. This is a movie that works on every level. Andy Walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film. This movie will rock you to the core.",

            "text": "\"Se7en\" is unique because of the extraordinary sympathy it manages to foster for its two main characters; it's unique because of its bleak, hopeless environment that serves as a symptom of civilization's general decline. It's strengthened by its brilliant performances capturing mostly decent people struggling to survive in the sewer without becoming tainted by it. The fictional John Doe would most likely agree with all these theoretical snapshots of despair - the difference comes in his psychopathic desire to come up with a plan that he thinks will solve it.Few forms of popular entertainment manage to afford the villain his say whilst still maintaining a sensible distance from his horrific acts. What I like best is the film's depressing contention that there isn't as much distinction as we think between the good guys and the bad guys. We're all affected by the distasteful aspects of society, but do we just hope that our own positive contributions will be enough to offset them - or in extreme situations, when we stare into the abyss, will the abyss stare back at us? Some may well be upset that the killer's justification contains reasoned objections. It is really only by resorting to crime that he reveals himself as a madman. Rather than be outraged, though, I prefer to celebrate good writing that allows us to see hidden facets of an issue, however unpalatable the resultant consequences of such a viewpoint may turn out to be.",

And, yes, it was indeed pretty much the first of it's kind which set a gritty, dark tone for crime films to come. Fine... I really have no specific negatives about the movie. HOWEVER... At the end of the day did I personally really find it THAT entertaining...? Not really... Yes, the unexpected ending is both shocking and dramatic, but does it honestly make sense...? ***SPOILERS Keven Spacey clearly and explicitly states the reasons why he has committed these murders: That people are doing all these very bad things everywhere all the time and people just don't care; so, he is setting 'the example' of what people should be doing to punish these 'sinners'. Okay... Now we are supposed to believe then that out of the blue he kills a COMPLETELY innocent woman (who is also pregnant) which to me the SOLE purpose is for an (admittedly extremely dramatic and shocking) plot device to set up Mills to kill him...??? Come on... I don't buy it. It is TOTALLY contrary to the very motivation of Kevin Spacey's character. But yeah, what an ending, sure... *** END SPOILERSAnyway, the question is, what do we find truly entertaining about a film? Putting stylistic touches or technical competence aside (such as visual effects, special or moody lighting, excellent cinematography, sound design, etc.) to me it primarily is this: How engaging or absorbing is the plot or story? How does it carry us along as it develops? How involving and complex are the characters and how interesting is the interplay and relationships between them? Now, these are just basics for most films. I realize that there are special genres or styles that we enjoy individually simply because we like those types of films (1950's Sci Fi, Slasher Horror Films, Ultra-Cheeeeezy Kung Fu movies, etc.) But, with this film at the end of the day what do we have...? Sure, we have this ghoulish, creepy, dark story of a killer who is killing by way of the 7 Deadly Sins. Okay... Characters...? Well, yes, all the actors concerned do a fine job; no real complaints there. BUT...! How deep or complex are they? How fascinating are they really? How engaging and intriguing are their interactions? To me personally, I felt that both the plot and character development to be rather shallow and superficial. I mean, WHAT do we really know about them? How deeply are we drawn into their lives and relationships? I'm sorry, but to me I really don't see a whole hell of a lot going on here other than a bunch of neatly lit, dark and somewhat moody scenes with little or no real substance. And the overall 'message' we are left with? The quite trite, common, and ultimately boring 'No one cares because the evil that people do is so arbitrary and horrible, so what's the point?' Yeah, real depth there...So, yeah, the film is well put together and there's nothing really 'BAD' about it per se; but, I do not feel myself that after all is said and done that you walk away from it with much of anything. There are darker and FAR more entertaining Horror films out there; and there are also dark, gritty, and INFINITELY more complex and engaging crime films out there. Films where afterward you actually feel like you have either been truly entertained by a story that makes you think and guess and wonder and also with characters who make you feel and care MUCH more about them because they are portrayed in a better, fuller, and more complex way.So, do I like dark, ambiguous, moody films? YOU BET! Do I like the dark, even nihilistic overtones of period FILM NOIR? ABSOLUTELY! Do I even like films with little substance BUT have TONS of style and mood (a la David Lynch, say) YES SIREE!!! But to me, this film, although of good quality, honestly strikes me as a 'One-Note' simplistic film and I just do NOT quite buy into the ending at all; it is merely a completely nonsensical plot device to give us a slam-bang ending. I mean, just a random example that comes to mind, I've seen Sandra Bullock's crime film 'MURDER BY NUMBERS' like 3 times and I've fully enjoyed it each time. You have a main character that is extremely complex and engaging; you have antagonists that are thoroughly riveting and with a layered relationship that is completely fascinating. And, you have a story that as it unreels truly draws you into the psyche, feelings, and motivations of the characters. And this is just an off the top, fairly above average example; nothing Earth shaking or anything, but just a simple example of what a movie is SUPPOSED to be. Entertaining...But, I will say this though... It has to have probably THE best opening credit sequence and background song ever!!!For this film though, I seriously doubt that I would ever really have the desire to sit down and watch it again...*** EDIT (2015.02.14)Heh, I'm actually thinking about giving this another chance and watching it again... :) I'm curious if my impressions will still be the same...",

I personally feel that the film adaptation falls incredibly short of what it could have been. The novel is beautifully crafted with suspense and character development, whereas the movie offers 2D characters that are simply there just because. Their faces remain blank the majority of the movie and their line delivery is flat and almost always as if they're bored talking.In true Shyamalan fashion, (yes, it's M. Night's daughter who directed it, but the apple doesn't fall far from the tree), the twist is a huge moment. While it does get revealed, it also changes a huge part of the original ending of the book, which makes the overall story even more of a 2D \"horror twist.\" The book's ending gave me chills; the movie's ending gave me cliché horror.I will say, I was eager to see who would play the character of Madeline, as she is such a force in the book as the most interesting character, as well as the one who has been trapped in the forest the longest, and Olwen Fouéré portrays her beautifully. The overall set design and atmosphere of the film is also done well, which helps but also makes the movie's poor script and characters feel all the more disappointing at times.While I won't actively encourage not seeing this movie, I DO encourage you to check out the book, by A. M. Shine. I'm also happy that an author whose work I appreciate it getting the attention of Hollywood to have his work made into a different media form - let's hope if his other works become film or television adaptations, that they'll be given the adaptation they deserve.",

Without spoiling too much, every time they were on screen I was fully engrossed. Enough was shown of them that made me wanting to see more.The worst unfortunately, are the characters which were one dimensional and lacking realism. They acted in ways no human would in this situation, especially the lead. A good horror movie requires realistic and likeable characters to vouch for. \"The Watchers\" struggled to create such.As most horrors unfortunately do, \"The Watchers\" does have some moments that I found a bit silly. Moments where you ask yourself \"why would she do that\" or \"why did that happen like that\". Such moments didn't help the film.I was skeptical towards the beginning on the film, thinking that it would meander in its plot and ultimately be repetitive. However, as the film progressed and its locations changed it kept the story fresh and wanting more. The ending boarded on lacklustre however, I didn't mind that it didn't get too ridiculous and over the top.

Just like most of her father's output, this is a handsomely mounted picture that struggles when it comes to the dialogue. What starts off as a slow burning thriller obsessed with voyeurism eventually gets wilder and more baffling with every twist and turn.Dakota Fanning gives a reserved lead performance which comes with standard issue trauma to overcome and she makes it work with a muted presence. Georgina Campbell, Oliver Finnegan, and Olwen Fouéré all do a good job with characters written in very broad strokes. Olwen Fouréré in particular really sells the sense of fear for the first half.Ishana Night Shyamalan's direction makes up for all the ham-fisted exposition with visual dynamism. Before it goes wild in that second half, there's a strong atmosphere that revels in the fear of the unknown to great effect and even when it goes off the rails later on, the bold swings are still appreciated. Abel Korzeniowski's score keeps it investing thanks to its mysterious nature.",

            "text": "While Ishana Night Shyamalan absolutely is her own filmmaker, and should her films judged on their own merits, The Watchers reminded me a lot of her fathers works in the ways that I usually find his films frustrating. I'm going to try my best not to keep comparing this to M. Night's movies but in particular The Watchers reminded me a lot of The Village and the issues I have with that film and I think I'd still feel that way with or without the familial connection.Because like The Village, The Watchers has a very intriguing hook that presents a lot of interesting story possibilities very early on but it never capitalises on them in any satisfying way. The dialogue is really weak here and it's frequently delivered in extremely wooden ways which most rears its head in the exposition. Because Shyamalan clearly doesn't believe in the less-is-more approach in that she feels the need to over explain everything and as a result the mystery never really feels that intriguing. Most of the reveals come across as very flat that feel like they lack sufficient build up to be satisfying.It's also very repetitive for most of the first 2 acts with it essentially following the same stricture of leaving this house and returning to it before night fall and it just came across as tiring rather tension-building. The reveals don't really feel earned and they're the one thing I wanted the film to explore more but the script really feels like it strikes the worst balance with what it chooses to focus on. The 3rd act was also a pretty big disappointment. The main action that's being built up for the entire film is achieved in a fairly standard way that doesn't feel fitting for what was being set up and it makes the mistake of feeling like it's getting ready to end only to go on for what felt like another 30 minutes.Thankfully what saves the film from being a complete waste of time is the truly impressive filmmaking on display. It's gorgeously shot and visually ambitious in a way that feels like it could only come from a first-time director. I thought the score was phenomenal as was the cinematography in a way that didn't feel like it was drawing too much attention to itself. There are some very effective scares and genuine scenes of tension, unfortunately it was just never sustained enough to keep my interest. It's the script that ultimately sunk this movie for me but it's very clear that Ishana Night Shyamalan has real talent behind the camera.The Watchers was frustrating waste of potential for me and something that never really felt like it capitalised on its intriguing set up. It's just reeks of a script that doesn't trust the intelligence of it's audience and I was just so consistently irritated at how the film kept going out of it's way to explain things in the most clunky and unimaginative ways possible. I can see what Shyamalan was going for, and if anything it makes more interested to read the novel, but her very clear talents just end up being wasted on a really poor script.",

            "text": "Writer-director Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of the iconic M. Night Shyamalan, steps into the spotlight with her debut film, The Watchers, a suspenseful horror film that's equal parts intriguing and frustrating. Mina (played with quiet intensity by Dakota Fanning), a young artist on a solo trip in Ireland, finds herself stranded in a remote forest with no way out. Seeking refuge, she stumbles upon a concrete bunker where three strangers are already holed up. But safety is a fleeting concept here. As night falls, a mysterious force emerges, forcing the group to huddle behind a large, one-way window-the only barrier between them and the unseen watchers.The film's greatest strength lies in its initial setup. The dense, uncharted forest evokes a sense of primal unease, and the concept of unseen entities lurking just beyond the window is undeniably creepy. Shyamalan keeps the creatures shrouded in shadow for a good portion of the film, relying on suggestion and flickering lights to build tension. This approach is reminiscent of classic monster movies like Alien or Jaws, where the unseen threat is often more terrifying than a fully revealed one.However, The Watchers struggles to maintain its momentum. The plot unfolds slowly, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to develop the characters beyond their basic survival instincts. While Fanning delivers a compelling performance, the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film throws in a childhood trauma element for Mina, but it feels tacked on rather than organically woven into the narrative.Visually, the film is a mixed bag. The use of colour is particularly interesting. The stark contrast between the warm, artificial light inside the bunker and the cold, oppressive darkness of the forest effectively creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability. However, some of the CGI effects used for the creatures later in the film feel a bit clunky and detract from the overall atmosphere. The editing is efficient, with jump scares used sparingly and to good effect.The film's ending, a signature Shyamalan twist, is sure to spark discussion. But unlike some of her father's more successful works, it doesn't quite land here. It feels more like a desperate attempt to inject a jolt of surprise rather than a satisfying conclusion to the established themes.The Watchers is a promising debut from Ishana Night Shyamalan. It showcases a clear understanding of suspense-building and a willingness to experiment with genre tropes. But, the underdeveloped characters, a slow pace, and a somewhat underwhelming twist hold the film back from reaching its full potential. If you're a fan of slow-burn horror with a dose of mystery, this might be worth a watch. But if you're expecting a truly terrifying experience, you might want to look elsewhere. It's an intriguing film with a great central premise, but its execution is uneven.",

            "text": "LIKES:The SettingThe Camera WorkThe ActingThe Character Story To A DegreeThe GraphicsThe WritingThe BirdThe Overall Story Is OkaySUMMARY:\nThe Watchers is a movie that for the most part relies heavily on the imagination and the isolation effect to do the lifting of the movie. Under the guidance of Ishana, I found this movie successful in accomplishing this goal with camera work that finds optimum angles to convey the emotion of isolation. A fantastic setting of the grey European forest alongside dynamic lighting and special effects draws out a dismal and isolated feeling that leaves one feeling hopeless at times given the desolate world. As the world continues to reveal itself and the Watchers begin to emerge, the graphics continue to look decent, with smooth and horrific animation, some awesome details in the skin texture, and some haunting movements that further rip away the comfort and elicit the horror element. Sound editing that accompanies it further immerses you into the doomed forest, done well to optimize the terror and try to set you up for the jump scares they were shooting for.In regards to the story to which the scares are built from, it's okay. Another symbolic and artistic approach, The Watchers' story relies heavily on some folklore for adaptation, something that does not show up until the second half of the film, and that revelation is both a bit more original and lackluster at the same time. A gradual revelation shows a bit more merit helps escalate how far this tale goes, and assists with helping draw out the horror and help fill in some of the story gaps. The character stories flesh things out a bit more, each of the four \"heroes\" holding some light and depth that hold some realistic relatability to care for the characters stuck in this mess. This movie holds heavy dialogue and the writing is smart at times and engaging, with heavy words, engaging delivery, and a strong atmospheric tone to establish the rules. I found the words brought to life well by most of the acting in the limited cast of this film. Fanning is about the same as always, listless, and creepy, and can portray the more somber emotions better than most as she faces the horrors of her past and present. Campbell offers more variety, bringing a bit of light into the movie that helps cut through the monotone depression and keep things engaging, especially during some of the trials forced upon her. Fouere is articulate and creepy in her role, all of her words so heavy, deep, and accented that they bring gravity to help enhance the story elements and somehow make the unknown more uncomfortable. Oliver Finnegan as well plays his role well, adding that unbalanced nature that adds a bit more of that psychological component to the film, further keeping the teeter-totter swaying back and forth Add in a cute bird that does very little and yet so much to help contrast the tone of the movie, and you round out the movie's likes for me.DISLIKES:The Plot's EndingMore Character Story NeededThe Revelation is DisappointingThe Twist Was PredictableMore Danger and Suspense NeededSome Odd Plot GapsA Bit More Emotional Components To the CharactersSUMMARY:\nDespite all the elements that were engaging, The Watchers has issues with some of the usual nuances this movie genre suffers from. In the story department, the plot's ending is a bit of a letdown for me, not because of the content that they chose, but because the execution is mediocre and rushed at times. Perhaps we needed more gradual discovery in the woods, more time spent in the danger field, and a few moments edited to be earlier in the film. The characters needed more depth as well, helping to give them more layers like they tried to give Fanning's character and helping give me more to either root for or against. The editing might have helped with smoothing out plot gaps and questions that distracted me during the time. They do answer some of the questions, but there are still some unresolved or a stretch. And the twist that came was predictable for many reasons, and thus the revelation was mediocre for me as well. Perhaps the biggest thing needed though, is more terror and close calls. The Watchers is missing so much of that, with the climactic components very mundane because there was so much more they could do. After such an epic setup with the environment and camera work, the lack of real challenges and trials was a very disappointing finish for horror fans who like a little more bite to their thriller.The VERDICT\nAnother movie of mundane horror, The Watchers has elements that the Shyamalan tribe knows how to do well in their movie media. Fantastic visuals, audio, and dialogue are the centerpieces of this film, with good characters and acting to a degree to bring it to life. It blends folklore and scares in a nice hybrid with some emotional depth beyond the typical horror movie. A smarter approach to conveying terror, returning to your imagination being the primary painter, it works so hard to play off of the fears of isolation, desolation, and hopelessness that made me feel more uncomfortable than the bad guys themselves. Where the movie fails is the pacing of the plot, spreading out that allure and explanation to give the film more bite, alongside needing more time and writing to the characters to build them up past the solemn humans we get. In addition, more scares, close calls, and strategy needed to be executed so that we might have a bit more excitement in suspense in their attempts to get out of the forest. Is this film worth a trip to the theater... I'm mixed. I would encourage you to support your local theater, but this movie feels better used at home to get the most out of your experience. In regards to my score, I rank The Watchers at:Fantasy/Horror/Mystery: 6.5-7.0\nMovie Overall: 6.0.",

            "text": "After reading several of the reviews on this one, I went into the theater with very low expectations. Those expectations were exceeded by miles!The plot of the movie is actually really solid. You can tell that it's based on a book, but that's not a bad thing. You're kind of rushed into the story quickly, but the premise is pretty interesting. I won't give any of it away to avoid spoilers, but I'll say it feels original. I haven't read the book, but the movie makes me want to.I feel like this film really shines in its attention to detail and ability to set the \"mood.\" There were some really good unsettling moments. It's not over the top scary by any means, but it does do a good job of being unsettling at times.The acting is solid and the characters are unique enough for the viewer to care about them. Olwen Fouéré is the standout, but the entire cast did well with their roles.Overall, I enjoyed it. The movie does have some flaws. It felt rushed at times, and there were some plot points that fell flat. However, this was still a really good horror/thriller movie worth investing your time in. I look forward to more from Ishana Shyamalan in the future!",

Her father's films are legendary for being hit and miss, and while he was a producer on this film, all of the marketing and trailers looked really creative and fresh. Whoever was in charge of the marketing for this needs a serious raise, because I was sold going in.Unfortunately she did not win me over with this debut, although I hope the best for her career and will try out whatever she attempts next.This wasn't all missing the mark. There were some very interesting, albeit undercooked, concepts in here. Creature design at times was interesting. Directing of certain sequences was competent. And some of the acting was fairly solid.Sadly, every intriguing aspect of the film felt so under developed and thought out. It honestly felt like a first draft of ideas that could have become something great, but just needed more time in the oven. The telegraphing of the plot from the beginning was so odd when you're trying to make the audience guess what's happening... but you already (unintentionally) revealed your hand. I think it was just poorly done foreshadowing that was accidentally too obvious? The complete lack of atmosphere and tension made the intentionally frightening scenes predictable and boring when I'm supposed to be on the edge of my seat.Also, near the very beginning of the film, the protagonist looks the audience dead in the eyes and addresses us via a proxy character. And then just no more 4th wall breaking. It's very weird and sloppy.Overall none of the main aspects of the film were necessarily bad, they just needed a lot more time in the oven before they were ready to be put to film.",

So expectations from her debut directorial movie, \"The Watchers\" is definitely very high. Even though the movie doesn't come anywhere close to the highs of Shyamalan's masterpieces, it does have its moments and is a pretty decent and unique thriller from a new director.The story is a bit strange, odd and unique. The suspense and acting is decent, there are a couple of good scares and the reveal on who the titular watchers is pretty good too. However the movie isnt as gripping as one would expect it to be. Everyone is expecting and actively on the look out for a Shyamalan-esque twist ending, hence making it difficult for Ishana to deliver something completely unexpected. However she does a good job with the final twist.Even though Ishana's style of film making is heavily inspired by her father but just like with Servant, she has her own take on the genre. The Watchers has its moments, its twists and feels every bit like a Shyamalan movie which he could have made after Signs and before Split. It is unique and well made but not as scary and good as it could have been. A decent thriller from a new film maker who is showing a lot of promise but nothing to rave about. Shyamalan-Lite.",

            "text": "In 1976, the comic called 'Jon' by comic book artist Jim Davis was published locally in the Pendleton Times. The comic was so successful that it was published nationwide under the name Garfield in 1978 and since then the greedy orange cat with a heart of gold has become indispensable. The drawing style was changed in 1984 to a more cartoon--like style as we actually know it well now. In 2002 was one of the most printed comics in the newspaper in 2570 newspapers worldwide with 263 million readers. Now with different animation series and different films we now get to see the second cinema film about the orange hangover. This time voiced by Chris Pratt as Garfield, who of course had a lot of success in recording Mario's voice in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Samuel L. Jackson speaks the voice of Garfield's father Vic and so we can mention a whole bunch of celebrities. In the Dutch version, these are Jim Bakkum and Jörgen Raymann who record the voices of Garfield and his father Vic. Either way, the film promises a lot of fun, fun and action.With many delays and postponements of the release date, of course due to the pandemic and problems with production, the time has finally come. In a kind of origin--like story telling, we see how a baby Garfield is just left behind by his father Vic. The story actually focuses a lot on that and because of this a main character like Jon is pushed back. When Garfield and his loyal buddy Odie are kidnapped, they end up with the crazy cat Jinx and her two mean service dogs Roland and Nolan. But why is Garfield actually kidnapped out of nowhere? That becomes clear when Vic appears on stage, but of course Garfield doesn't want to know anything about Vic at all. We all understand that leaving Garfield when he was still a kitten had a different reason than that you would think at first glance and that is quite a shame, because it makes the film very predictable for the older viewers. You notice from this that a film like this is really made for an audience under 10 years old, but don't be put off, because apart from that fact, the film is really entertaining for an older audience.The animation itself is average and nothing more than that. Nowadays it is difficult for most animated films to say anything about it, given that it is most similar in style. Well, well it was not expected in advance that we would get to see an artistic masterpiece, so in that respect the film succeeds in that area with flying colours. The music was a positive point, this was in the hands of composer John Debney and at some points the music was completely reminiscent of the beautiful melancholic sounds that Thomas Newman often makes. In the end, the big picture is crazy fun and you won't be bored for seconds. The humor is good and fun and things like Catflix where Garfield watches cat movies are hilarious. In the end, you have to stay there during the credits for the funny cat movies that continue to play when the credits start rolling.Garfield has become a successful and funny movie for the whole family. The jokes are fun, the animation is fine and Garfield and Odie get the laughs on their hands very often. Perhaps the predictability of the film could have been a little less, because this actually only makes the film suitable for children up to 10 years old, but well, this is not something you should also care about, because the film is just too fun for that. The animation itself is standard, doesn't excel in anything, but that's fine. The music pops out and from time to time it is reminiscent of a soundtrack that Thomas Newman could have made. Just stay seated at the end credits too because the crazy cat movies that Garfield watches on Catflix make for a last smile on the face.",

Its not bad, I just don't think Garfield fans will like it, but the kids will certainly be all over it. I took this movie with a pinch of salt and it was watchable enough.

The problem is that after the many laughs of the introduction, the plot suddenly declines, introducing unnecessary secondary characters and the script falls into absurdity.

The film leaves you with a beautiful message that many of us should take into account. It's not a great adaptation, because it takes several elements that aren't the same as the original series but that's okay, because you replace them with other elements that make the movie feel refreshing and different. Like any movie, not everything is good and this is no exception since there are some characters that I didn't like so much, such as the villain, which in my opinion is the weakest part of the film.

Cats Don't Dance was pretty decent, Emperor's New Groove is very funny and entertaining, and Chicken Little is way too mean for my taste.The Garfield Movie had potential, but just not enough cheesy goodness.Positives: the animation and music are solid... that's it. Everything else was all over the place.Yeah, that's it. I don't want to sound too harsh, but the comedy is hit or miss (most of the better gags are already in the trailers), some of the characters are forgettable (I already forgot the villIan), the plot was all over the place, Jon gets hugely sidelined for 90% of the whole film, I didn't get most of the pop culture references, and my biggest issue? The pacing.It's either way too quick (like Jon's worried phone calls) or waaaaay too slow (I felt the ending took forever to wrap things up); plus a few tonal whiplashes which caught me off guard or I later found distracting.I also found Vic and Garfield's back and fourth through the first half a tad bit grating, the subplot with Otto and his \"night\" wasn't really needed, the villain's plan was very weak (plus their sidekicks turning good, last millisecond), and I also wasn't a fan of Chris Pratt as Garfield; you couldn't have hired Frank Welker? Not to mention the multiple plot beats we've seen in other animated films, and sooo much better.Sooo yeah, it's frustratingly... eh! It could've been great if it scrapped the Otto plot entirely, focused more on Jon actually looking for Garfield and Odie, if the villain had a much better scheme, vice versa.There is a lot of potential for an animated Garfield movie, but this one's just awkwardly paced, bland, and safe. It's a harmless hour and a half; and just because it's a kid's film, that doesn't excuse it from its flaws (there's SO many better films for that demographic).As a person who appreciates and adores the art of filmmaking, I wanted to have fun with this one, and there were a few laughs - but thinking about it some more, I want to have a better lasagna.",

            "text": "As someone who was genuinely excited about Garfield 2024, I found it to be incredibly disappointing. My expectations were high, but the film failed to meet them on nearly every level. This film had the potential to bring the beloved, lasagna-loving cat back to the forefront of popular culture, but instead, it felt like a missed opportunity.Firstly, the storyline was lackluster and uninspired. Garfield, a character known for his witty remarks and clever humor, was relegated to a series of uninspired jokes and predictable plot points. The narrative lacked the cleverness and charm that made Garfield a household name in the first place. Instead of the sharp, sarcastic humor fans have come to expect, the film relied heavily on slapstick comedy and tired clichés, which felt out of place for a character like Garfield.The animation style also left much to be desired. While advances in animation technology have allowed for more realistic and detailed visuals, Garfield 2024's animation felt oddly lifeless. The characters, especially Garfield, lacked the expressive quality that made the original comic strips and earlier adaptations so endearing. The film's attempt to modernize Garfield's look resulted in a character that felt distant and unrelatable. The charm and warmth of the hand-drawn Garfield were lost in the transition to a more polished, yet sterile, digital form.Moreover, the voice acting was another area where the film fell short. The choice of voice actor for Garfield was crucial, as the character's dry, sarcastic delivery is one of his most defining traits. Unfortunately, the performance felt flat and uninspired, lacking the nuance and timing needed to bring Garfield's personality to life. This was a significant letdown, as the voice is a critical component of the character's identity.The supporting characters, including Jon and Odie, were also poorly handled. Jon, who should be the lovable, bumbling foil to Garfield's antics, was portrayed as overly dramatic and whiny, making it hard to sympathize with him. Odie, usually the simple yet lovable dog, was reduced to a mere background character with little impact on the story.One of the most significant disappointments was the film's failure to capture the essence of what makes Garfield so enduring. The original comic strips and earlier adaptations balanced humor with a sense of heart and relatability. Garfield's laziness, love of food, and disdain for Mondays are characteristics that many people can identify with, making him a beloved character. However, Garfield 2024 seemed to forget these core elements, opting instead for a generic, cookie-cutter approach that stripped away the uniqueness of the character.Additionally, the film's pacing was off, making it difficult to stay engaged. Scenes dragged on without contributing to the overall narrative, and the jokes often fell flat. The lack of a compelling storyline or character development made it hard to invest in the film, and by the end, it felt more like a chore to watch rather than an enjoyable experience.Garfield 2024 was a major disappointment. As someone genuinely excited about the film, I was left feeling let down and frustrated. The lackluster storyline, uninspired animation, poor voice acting, and mishandling of beloved characters all contributed to a film that failed to live up to its potential. Garfield deserved better, and so did the fans who were eagerly awaiting his return. This film missed the mark in almost every aspect, turning what should have been a delightful revival into a forgettable and frustrating experience.",

Garfield is basically a punching bag midway the film and he likes to complain alot (like gumball for example) and he is sometimes kind off stupid, AND I BARELY SAW HIM SLEEP! Yep, Garfield barely sleeps in this film, And there are false statements like garfield saying He's never jumped, what do you mean? In the cartoons you've jumped alot, he's annoying midway but luckily becomes bearable in the end again.Onto odie, WOAH he's different, so odie still is a slobbering dog in the film, But he's that one character that does everything (like gromit for example) and he's smarter, and surprisingly never asked garfield to throw the bone for him, neither was he called stupid or was kicked from the table, Basically he takes the deuteragonist role as he is always there in the adventure with garfield.Jon? Oh... Well he doesnt get involved in the adventure alot, He atleast acts like his goofy self and is a guy with no friends, Until (Baby garfield came) Since he waited too long for his father Vic and got too hungry, So he started eating everything in the restaurant, After this, Jon becomes a major character calling cellphone numbers to look for his pets, You do not see him flirt with women. Or do something clumsyAnd as for the other characters, Vic is the tritagonist and garfield's father, otto is a grumpy bull Who's love interest is a cow, Jinx is a white cat who likes milk, And the main antagonist of the film who wants vic dead, She asks Garfield, Odie and vic to go too the milk factory Which is basically the plot of the film, We'll get to it later, Roland is a dog who is basically the sidekick of jinx Alongside this other dog who end up becoming good guys in the end battle,For the rest, Liz only appears twice, Nermal appears once (at the ending sequence of the film) and doesn't talk since its basically a cameo appearance I suppose.. Arelene doesn't appear at all! Couldn't she have been the love interest of garfield in the film?7 huh? Well the reason why its a seven is because of the fact that the original garfield characters dont get much focus on, The movie focuses more on the new characters that we dont even know. Yea the OG garfield characters have more charm unfortunately, I kinda liked jinx though, But she barely made a joke.Now onto the plotPlot/Storyline: 5/10\nThe storyline is pretty weak, but the plot is decent, Garfield and odie get kidnapped while getting a midnight snack And brought into a place where they get hung up by the legs, Until a mysterious figure saves him, That mysterious figure turns out to be his dad, They go on an adventure to get to a milk factory for jinx, Until vic betrays the cat and dog duo just to get kidnapped by jinx, Garfield notices that vic betrayed garfield just to save him So garfield goes too save vic with odie, garfield fights off the antagonists with italian food, the action is very good, And was pretty thrilling, Expect emotional scenes as well.Comedy: 6/10\nThe movie's humour focuses ALOT on slapstick, Like I said before, Garfield is the movie's punching bag So you'll see him go through very much here, Most of the slapstick is funny But it gets very repetitive, The dialogue thats meant to be funny is very mediocre, As most people in my theater only chuckled at the dialogue, they laughed alot at the slapstick though, The movie felt very low in comedy at times, I thought it was gonna be like garfield gets real where there isn't a single joke at all, the jokes midway are very weak (some were a tad bit funny), But get stronger in the end.Overall: the movie has the garfield spirit, but its weak in storyline and flops midway, but honestly its a good adaptation of the comic strip and atleast better than the other 5 garbage disposal films, But its still a mediocre affair that can only be reccomended to garfield fans.",

Garfield and this world just fit animation so well, especially this style. This is much better than the live action movies. Chris Pratt honestly did a great job of capturing Garfield's personality and mannerisms. I know his casting was a little controversial but it definitely seems like he went all out and gave it everything he had to give us a really good performance. I feel like Pixar and the Spider Verse movies have gotten people to judge some animated films way too harshly, because no way can every single animated movie be that incredible.

Jackson.SynopsisWorld-famous Garfield, the Monday-hating, lasagna-loving house cat, is about to have an adventure in the wild outside world! After an unexpected reunion with his long-lost father - the scruffy stray cat Vic - Garfield and his canine friend Odie are forced to abandon their perfect, pampered lives by joining Vic in a hilarious and very risky heist.A new adventure of the pasta-loving cat is what hits theaters this week. The new Garfield animated film is a film that is designed only for the youngest members of the family, with childish humor and a truly harmless adventure for everyone.It is a correct animated film that does not know how to take advantage of the qualities of a character who has much more grace than what is given to him in this film. If we take into account that the adult audience will also see this film, it is precisely that audience that is left well separated from the final result. A film that is difficult to connect with and halfway through you start to get bored, even though it is a fairly short film and fast in events, but it is very designed for the little ones, it is difficult for the older ones to get hooked on the story.Garfield works because he is a fun character, but he still doesn't manage to have his best adventure on screen unlike Odie, who incredibly has more brilliant moments in the film without saying a single word. A film designed to fulfill and generate quick and easy money, but as a new proposal that comes to give us something more refreshing from our beloved cat, this is definitely not the best option.In any case, it has fun moments and such a positive and friendly story that at least you leave with a feeling of affection and positivity towards the world. A film for the little ones in the house and a time of entertainment once again enjoying a character that continues to accompany generations for decades.",

Also, WHERES NERMAL??? It would be nice of nermal have shown up in this movie at all. Also it kind of does Garfield well, let's start on the pros now. It shows how he hates Mondays at the start of the film and even his backstory of which his dad tried to get the food but Jon \"adopted\" him. Now it shows how much food Garfield eats. I mean, he can down an entire pizza with one bite by enlargening his mouth. If I'm being honest, it shows how evil the... \"mom\" is. Yeah I'm not sure of it.",

From the very beginning, it felt like a blatant cash grab rather than a heartfelt tribute to the beloved comic strip.The movie's biggest flaw is its soullessness. The charm and wit of Jim Davis's original comic strips are nowhere to be found. Instead, we get a hollow, lifeless version of Garfield that feels more like a caricature than the lazy, lasagna-loving cat we know and love. The jokes fall flat, the dialogue is uninspired, and the overall tone is more annoying than entertaining.Even worse, the entire film feels like one giant advertisement. Product placements are shamelessly crammed into nearly every scene, making it hard to stay immersed in the story. It seems like the filmmakers were more interested in securing brand deals than in creating a meaningful experience for the audience. This relentless commercialism detracts significantly from any potential enjoyment.The animation style, while technically competent, lacks creativity and originality. It feels like the animators were going through the motions rather than putting genuine effort into bringing Garfield and his world to life. The characters' expressions are often stiff and unconvincing, and the overall visual design is bland and forgettable.The plot, if you can even call it that, is predictable and formulaic. It feels like the writers threw together a series of generic set pieces with little regard for coherence or narrative depth. There are no memorable moments or emotional beats-just a series of tedious scenes that fail to engage or entertain.In summary, the new Garfield movie is a soulless, commercialized mess that fails to capture the essence of the original comic strip. It's a clear example of prioritizing profit over creativity, and it shows in every aspect of the film. Save your time and money and skip this one. Garfield deserves better, and so do we.",

I can't compare this film to the other Bill Murray films, as I haven't seen them. This time, Garfield is voiced by Chris Pratt, who's earning a solid living voicing lead characters in animated films - 'The Lego Movie', 'Onward', 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie'. We get a nice flashback to how kitten Garfield, super-cute, and Jon (Hoult) first met and their comfortable life with dog Odie (Guillen).The film then turns into a Mission:Impossible style heist film, as Garfield's dad, Vic (Jackson) is blackmailed into robbing milk from a dairy, that Garfield and Odie are coerced into too. The \"baddie\" is Jinx (Waddingham) - a fluffy-white cat that's straight out of Blofeld's lap from James Bond - as well as her mean-looking dog goons, Roland (Goldstein) and Nolan (Yang). This is where we meet Otto (Rhames), the bull - very fitting having Ving Rhames in the heist part of the film! There's lots of action and slapstick \"injuries\", as Garfield, Odie and Vic break into the dairy factory and also a train.The whole Garfield-out-of-the-house is a little different and means Jon's not really in it much. Garfield also isn't too surly and is actually friendly with Odie, which is nice. There's probably not as much charm as 'The Peanuts Movie', but it does have a nice little story about family, with Vic and Garfield and explaining why they were separated for the kids. Some smaller kids may find parts scary, particularly the big dog and the factory scene with the cheese and knives. Nothing too hilarious, but enough laughs for the adults to keep it interesting.",

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, \"we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it.\" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.",

            "text": "I will keep this short for the sake of not spoiling anything.Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in \"Interstellar\" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work.",

            "text": "Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot and engineer, is now reluctantly scraping together a living as a farmer on a starving Earth. With sandstorms swirling and food supplies dwindling by the day, it doesn't seem likely that Cooper's children, stoic Tom and inquisitive Murphy, will have much of a world left to inherit when they grow up. While investigating a \"ghost\" in Murphy's bedroom, Cooper deciphers a message that brings him to a top-secret NASA base. Once there, Cooper learns from his former mentor, Dr Brand (Michael Caine), that NASA is looking for solutions to Earth's crisis in other galaxies. A recently-opened wormhole has given NASA and its scientists access to a whole new galaxy of planets. Brand appeals to Cooper to pilot the final and most important mission: to determine whether any of three identified planets can truly host human life. But it's a journey from which Cooper might never return - one that will take him away from his kids and everything he has ever known and loved.That's not even the half of it – Nolan's narrative is a sprawling, ambitious one that asks heavy metaphysical questions about the position and role of humanity in the universe, filtered through the prism of a father and daughter whose bond transcends time and space. It's shot through with complex scientific theories about wormholes and time travel courtesy of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne (who served as a consultant on the film). Indeed, much of Interstellar plays with such philosophical gravity that one can't help wondering if it's simply too deep a subject to be effectively communicated in a movie that must also create emotional stakes and real characters.Clocking in at almost three hours, Interstellar pulses with intelligence and occasional bursts of brilliance. The science and emotion of its story works best on each planet they manage to visit, with Nolan crafting some chillingly smart sci-fi moments amidst the human drama experienced by Cooper's crew. As badly as Cooper wants to save enough fuel to make the return trip home, Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) has both professional and personal stakes in visiting the planet that's furthest away from the wormhole. They trade hope for time, the minutes they use to hunt for salvation translating into the loss of decades with their loved ones. The film is at its best when the members of the Endurance - including David Gyasi's Romilly and Wes Bentley's Doyle - confront one another, and establish contact (or fail to do so) with the scouting teams that preceded them through the wormhole.But Interstellar also suffers from a bloated and faintly silly final act. The science of it may be well-founded (who knows, after all, what miraculous answers really do lie within a black hole?) and the concept very cool, but it doesn't quite translate as such. Instead, the film hyper-blasts itself into a oddly cheerful (and confusing) ending that feels purely fictional and not at all scientific. There's no denying, either, that Nolan could have carved half an hour or more out of Interstellar without losing any of its narrative or emotional density. Instead, many scenes unfold in an almost obstinately languid fashion, including a moment when Cooper is left gasping for oxygen on the icy terrain of an alien planet. It's pretty evident, too, that Nolan really wanted to make sure his audiences knew how little greenscreen he used to make the film; for no other discernible reason, his camera lingers in extreme close-up - and far too often - on the exterior shells of the various spacecrafts designed for the film.Nolan can afford the best when it comes to his cast as well, and it shows. McConaughey anchors the film with a gravitas and tenderness quite unknown before his career McConnaissance, and he's ably supported by a steely Hathaway, whose character, just like the film she's in, blends cold, pragmatic science with a churning wealth of emotion. Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon, in roles perhaps best left unspecified to avoid any explicit spoilers, are excellent too - the former radiates quite enough warmth and intelligence to make us believe that she can save the world, and the latter admirably treads in morally grey areas to good effect.For months before its release, Nolan kept Interstellar firmly under wraps. Everyone speculated that it would be a game-changer - a sci- fi blockbuster as thrilling and thought-provoking as it is entertaining. In some ways, that's true of the final product: Nolan's film is brave, brainy film-making, and it looks absolutely spectacular. But, on closer examination, Interstellar loses some of its gloss and varnish - and beneath it all lies an unwieldy script that meanders a little too long and wastes a little too much of the big, breathtaking ideas that underpin its story.",

            "text": "OK, I'll keep this brief, but I'll also nail my credentials to the mast first. I know science, cosmology, sci-fi and film-making pretty well. I have, in the past taught film studies at degree level, and worked on the production of more than one major Hollywood sci-fi film. I read Stephen Baxter and I like space stuff a lot. More than a lot. And why am I telling you this? Because I should have loved \"Interstellar\", but I didn't for one simple reason: It is a truly dreadful piece of film-making.I won't even bother with dissecting the \"science\" in the film, because that isn't really the issue (it is wrong on pretty much every level). I'm not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix. And I'll ignore the sub-standard special effects - because FX don't a great movie make.The issues I have with Interstellar are essentially these: The film is an arse-numbing three hours long, and feels far longer. The pace is stunningly poorly judged - the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost.The characters are paper-thin, and I didn't care about any of them. The plot is entirely derivative (mostly of the vastly superior \"Contact\"). The special effects aren't special at all and the editing (or lack of) is so self-indulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity. The result is a plodding, flabby, and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact.I won't go on, but special mention must be made of the planets - Paddling World and Coldworld. You see virtually nothing of either, and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor CGI painfully inferior to \"A Perfect Storm\" and a location less dramatic than your own back garden.I've probably not been a brief as I intended, but as I write this I feel the disappointment and actual anger I felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again. It was a total let-down and a waste of more than three hours of my life. The gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd, and I am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me, or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by. I am fairly confident I didn't doze off, although I desperately wanted to.So in conclusion, \"Contact\" did all of this far, far better, fifteen years ago. In Contact the characters are human, believable, beautifully realised and you care what happens to them. The relationship between Father and Daughter is deeply moving and inspiring. But then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway, dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, the science is accurate and entirely plausible (it was written by Carl Sagan after all), the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle, and it has something very profound to say.Contact is everything Interstellar is not, and it has a considerably shorter running time. Contact brought tears to my eyes, Interstellar bored me to tears.",

            "text": "I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him \"X\". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly \"X\", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say \"we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick\" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought.",

His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship. Time is an issue as it moves at a different rate near the black hole; this means that as hours pass for Cooper years are passing back on Earth.This film starts at a gentle pace gradually explaining what has happened to the Earth before getting the mission to save the world started; this means the separation of Cooper and Murphey is more emotional. Once the mission is underway there is plenty of tension, including some particularly gripping moments on the second planet they visit. The small cast does a fine job; especially Matthew McConaughey, who plays Cooper; Anne Hathaway, who plays Amelia Brand a scientist aboard the mission; and Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain, who play the younger and older Murphey. The effects looked great, as one would expect in a film from Christopher Nolan, and I was pleased that space was depicted as silent; something that is both scientifically correct but also more impressive. Things do get a little confusing near the end but in a way that made me want to watch again rather than causing frustration.Overall I'd recommend this to somebody looking for intelligent science fiction in the mould of '2001 – A Space Odyssey' although this has more emotion to it than that classic.",

            "text": "The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.You don't necessarily have to understand it immediately : The film will raise questions in you, such as : what is it to be a human being, is there some physical limitations to our humanity, how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge, is there other dimensions that we can not access to, and above all: what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? Is this bond only intelligible, or is it also tangible ? All these questions resonate in harmony in Nolan's Interstellar. Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured.Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves \"behind\" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the \"black hole beyond the horizon\" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, \"all it takes is a little push ! \"*you'll have to see the movie to figure that one out.Félix Tardieu, November 1st, 2014",

The film is full of flaws, the biggest being the runtime. I may never see this movie again because of how long it felt! It feels like a lot of scenes are unneeded, and were made just so the movie could be longer, because Christopher Nolan wanted to make it seem really epic. I'm sure if Nolan cut a huge chunk of the movie out, it would've been better. A film by Nolan that is better than this one is \"The Dark Knight\", which has a somewhat long runtime, but it feels way shorter than it's runtime, and is extremely entertaining throughout. \"Interstellar\" is so long that it starts to really drag on and, at times, I began to just zone out.The film is also a bit too dramatic. The dialogue about how \"love conquers all\" seemed very unnecessarily corny, as well as a few other select scenes in the movie. However, some sequences were quite powerful, especially the ending, which, actually, was kind of creepy. The concept of time was very prominent throughout the film, and it lead to some pretty creative and powerful sequences.Overall, the film is recommended, but you should be warned that this movie was LOOOOOOOONG!!!!!!",

            "text": "Not so long ago, I was involved in a debate to decide what the best film of all time was. Not necessarily my favourite or the most re-watchable, but just the best film. Somehow, after a drink, a few arguments and a lot of contemplation, I singled out The Silence of the Lambs. The question remains though... was I actually onto something?The Silence of the Lambs follows agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is desperate to apprehend the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To try and help her gain insight into the mind of a psychopath, the aspiring agent must consult the genius, yet sinisterly manipulative psychiatrist turned cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). From the very first scene, Silence of the Lambs' genius is obvious. During the opening credits, with eerie music displaced on top, the camera follows Clarice, with almost stalker-like intent, as she completes a training course in an initially empty forest. This immediately founds a cruel feeling of fear, dread and unease that continues to build throughout the film... though there are noticeable spikes during any visits to the film's most infamous character.Hannibal Lector - \"A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.\"The Silence of the Lambs is one of three films in history to win the big 5 awards at the Oscars (best picture, actress, actor, screenplay and director) and the reason for those wins is thanks in large part to every and any scene involving Clarice's interaction with the eponymous Hannibal Lector. Imagine, Heat's diner talk, The Dark Knight's interrogation, or The Godfather's meetings. This is the level Silence of the Lamb's interviews are at. With closeups of both characters faces capturing their psychological chess game in exquisite detail, both actors are at the top of their games and refuse to provide respite for their entranced audience. Jodie Foster perfectly encapsulates the intelligent, ambitious yet emotionally delicate Starling who along with Anthony Hopkin's now iconic portrayal of the psychopathic Lector create a pairing so iconic that their interactions have been parodied to no end (references range from The Batman to Stranger Things to even Tom and Jerry).Hannibal Lector - \"And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?\"Clarice Starling - \"Lambs. The lambs were screaming.\"Commonly touted alongside Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley as one of the all-time-best movie heroines, Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling is an icon. Whilst this is largely down to the captivating performance at the heart of the film, another crucial reason is how the director (Jonathon Demme) frames our protagonist. Throughout the film, the camera will occasionally position itself in Clarice's point of view. This means that whoever Clarice is talking to (serial killer or otherwise) will often stare directly down the lens and thus directly at the audience. This allows viewers to become a pseudo-psychologist themselves and deduce the intentions and thoughts of multiple characters in Clarice's periphery. Furthermore, this technique also forces audiences to identify with Clarice, as she navigates a case that, due to her age, gender and position, involves all eyes being on her.Jack Crawford - \"Starling, when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you didn't it? It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him.\"Clarice Starling - \"It matters, Mr Crawford. Cops look at you to see how to act. It matters.\"Thankfully, to match the astounding performances at the heart of the film, The Silence of the Lambs bolsters a captivating, quick-paced and unbearably suspenseful story spread across a 2-hour runtime. By using the conversations with Hannibal almost like beginnings of a chapter, the film signposts where the story is heading, without giving any of its delicious twists away. This feat is even more impressive as Lector himself is only on screen for 24 minutes and 52 seconds, yet the pacing is so exquisite that his absence is never truly felt. Furthermore, the hunt for Buffalo Bill serves to keep both the audience and Clarice on their toes. By drip-feeding revelations surrounding Bill's psyche and own particular brand of horror, a sense of trepidation, tension and terror is expertly raised throughout the film. This then reaches a crescendo where, after a clever misdirect, Clarice finally confronts Bill in what has to be one of the most suspenseful battles ever put to screen. Does anybody breathe when the lights turn out?Clarice Starling - \"He won't come after me.\"Ardelia Mapp - \"Oh really?\"Clarice Starling - \"He won't. I can't explain it... He - he would consider it rude.\"With a haunting score, powerful performances and exquisite pacing, The Silence of the Lambs personifies everything a psychological thriller should be. It is thematically rich, touching on overt and covert sexism, childhood trauma and the philosophy behind serial killers all while brimming with endlessly quotable dialogue, a lightning-fast pace and iconic characters. Honestly, I doubt many could argue with The Silence of the Lambs' status as both a classic for its genre as well as the medium of film as a whole. However, although not everyone may agree with it being the best film of all time, after a rewatch, I'd willingly fight anyone who claims it isn't close.",

Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.",

That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, \"Buffalo Bill.\" \"Bill\" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent \"Clarice Starling\" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as \"Jack Crawford.\" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts \"Clarice,\" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.\"Silence Of The Lambs\" has turned into a modern-day \"classic.\" If by some odd chance you have never seen this movie, be warned it is a dark, difficult story to watch at times....but it will get your mind off other things.",

They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses \"deceptive cutting\" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars",

When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention.

Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarice's inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does. The film's soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the film's dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecter's piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarice's eyes. The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him. Lecter's lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as \"it\" in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing. A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarice's development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, \"He would consider that rude\". Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanity's existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day.",

It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see.",

            "text": "Brilliant Best Picture of 1991 that never gets old.  \"The Silence of the Lambs\" deals with a young FBI cadet (Oscar-winner Jodie Foster) who is sent to interview a captured madman (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) to find out about a serial killer (Ted Levine) who is stripping the skin from his female victims after they die.  The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of \"The Silence of the Lambs\" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.  Hopkins dominates in spite of the fact he has approximately 17 minutes of time in the film.  This is a film that will wrap itself around you and you will likely never be able to shake some of the key elements you have seen in this amazing masterpiece.  5 stars out of 5.",

            "text": "For thirty years Norman Bates reigned unopposed as the number one movie villain of all time. But in 1991 along came Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant Baltimore psychiatrist, to challenge Bates for the on-screen mantle of unparalleled depravity. Cultured and erudite, Lecter reads Marcus Aurelius, listens to classical music, and drinks only the finest wine {a glass of Chianti to go along with fava beans and liver}. Oh.... and by the way, did I forget to mention that he's a cannibalistic serial killer?Thomas Harris' diabolical shrink first appeared in the book \"Red Dragon\", adapted quite decently by Michael Mann in 1986 and retitled MANHUNTER {later remade less satisfactory in 2002 under its original title}. Despite Mann's film not making much of a splash at the time, plans were nonetheless underway to bring Harris' second novel \"Silence Of The Lambs\" to the screen. The unlikely person interested in turning it into a motion picture was Gene Hackman, who hoped to make this his directorial debut. Orion Pictures was onboard, but Hackman soon had cold feet over the grisly subject matter and dropped out. As writer Ted Tally was consuming himself with putting together a solid screenplay, Orion succeeded in convincing Jonathan Demme to direct.The first actress slated to play Clarice Starling was Michelle Pfeiffer and, for the same reasons as Hackman, also had her apprehensions and bowed out. Replacing Pfeiffer was Jodie Foster, who'd just won an Oscar for portraying a rape victim in THE ACCUSED. As for Lecter, the original choice was Sean Connery (!), who declined. No knock against Connery, but that was a good thing too. Try to visualize, if you can, 007 saying \"I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner\". Doesn't quite roll off the tongue so fluidly, does it?The next one considered was Anthony Hopkins, based largely on his performance in THE ELEPHANT MAN, a choice which I thought was odd! His character of Dr Frederick Treves was a decent, compassionate man of medicine who transformed one person's heartbreakingly miserable life around for the better, whereas Hannibal Lecter possesses all the compassion of a Komodo dragon. It took the actor only ten pages of reading the script before realizing this was the best part he'd ever read, and heartily agreed to play Lecter. To capture the right accent for his character he based the voice partially on Katharine Hepburn and Truman Capote.The heroine of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee at Quantico nearing the conclusion of her apprenticeship. A native of rural West Virginia, Clarice was orphaned as a young girl when her widowed policeman father was shot to death in the line of duty. Jack Crawford, her superior in the Behavioural Sciences department assigns her to conduct an interview with one of the most infamous serial killers in the country. Crawford warns her in advance not to reveal anything personal to him, telling her \"Believe me, Starling, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head\".Dr Lecter's home for the last decade has been a Baltimore asylum for the criminally insane. He is so dangerous that he and three other inmates are segregated from the general population, which illustrates just how evil he truly is. Prior to her meeting him, Dr Chilton, the director of the institution, shows Clarice a photograph of an unfortunate staffer who made the grave mistake of turning her back to him.We never actually see what Lecter did to the woman. With Demme's camera in an upward position facing towards Clarice, our heroine's stoic, yet revealing, reaction is enough to put our imaginations into overdrive....and give us the willies!!! Unlike the other garden variety psychos displaying the usual clichéd mannerisms, Lecter simply greets her with a casual, disarming \"Good morning\". Hopkins' phrasing of those two words will put a chill in the audience's spines.Starling has been sent in the hopes that the not-so-good doctor will provide a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who has been abducting and murdering young women. Intrigued by his visitor, Lecter begins insinuating himself into her psyche by giving an extraordinary accurate character analysis. Their cat-and-mouse interaction is fascinating to watch as Lecter alternates between co-operation {somewhat} and toying with her emotions.Lecter's cryptic clues lead Clarice to the discovery of a severed head belonging to one of his former patients. Though admitting to preserving the cranium prior to his incarceration, Lecter insists he was not the killer. However, he does know the identity of the dead man's lover, the suspect known only as Buffalo Bill. He simply wants to torment everyone by taking his own sweet time before disclosing it.The stakes suddenly get higher in the psychological chess match between Lecter and Starling. Buffalo Bill's next victim happens to be the missing daughter of a Tennessee senator. With pressure now coming from Washington, Clarice approaches Lecter with a {phony} offer of a transfer in exchange for his identification of the serial killer. Unfortunately, this quid pro quo is overhead by Chilton, a womanizing creep whose self-love is more than just a summer romance. His ego will lead to subsequent events that nothing positive will come of.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is undeniably Jonathan Demme's finest hour. One of his visual trademarks is having his actors speaking directly into the camera, giving us the impression that we're the ones actually interacting with them, and thus putting us in the other person's shoes. Demme's technique is not always effective , but it certainly works with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS because having Hannibal Lecter, in particular, addressing us face-to-face is enough to put us off balance.In the decades since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, critics and audiences alike have rhapsodized endlessly about the tit-for-tat exchanges between Lecter and Starling. It's an intriguing matchup for sure; he's a remorseless monster, yet somehow this tenacious Southern belle has tapped into his not-so-beautiful mind just as much he has with hers. As he admires Clarice's steely perseverance within a male dominated profession, she may be the only person in the world whom Lecter genuinely wishes no harm to come towards. And his ingenious escape at the ¾ mark makes for one of the tensest scenes in cinema history.For all of its bona fide moments of fright, one aspect which I think Demme doesn't get enough praise for is his vivid depiction of America's rust belt. Thanks to the exceptional work by production designer Kristi Zea and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, Demme gives us the most bleakly evocative portrait of lower middle class poverty since BONNIE AND CLYDE.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS became only the third movie to capture the 5 major Academy Awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Ted Tally's first rate adaptation. Hopkins was knighted shortly after his triumph, and when asked by a reporter which honor was more satisfying, he replied \"The Oscar. It changed my life\". For Foster, this was her second win, but this performance was so towering that I'm not sure if anyone other than the most intrepid cinephile would remember what film her first Oscar was for.Back in 1991, I remember reading a review of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS where the writer of the article proclaimed that Hannibal Lecter may be the greatest movie villain of all time. I thought that was quite an audacious pronouncement for anybody to make. The film was still going through a strong theatrical run, and conventional cinema wisdom assumed that nobody would ever unseat Hitchcock's ultimate mama's boy. But as it turned out, that critic, whoever he or she was, ended up having the last laugh. 🔚",

            "text": "There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with \"I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)",

            "text": "It's impossible to comment on SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as being a mere film . Its release was a watershed in popular culture and has influenced a myriad of imitations that are far too numerous to mention . Much of this success is down to director Jonathan Demme who has made the film so effective by coming up with the strikingly simple idea of filming everything in dim lighting which gives SILENCE a moody and brooding atmosphere that was absent from movies in the previous decade . Ironically enough this is as typical of 90s film making as MANHUNTER was of 80s movies . Howard Shore's score also helps the proceedings and Jodie Foster gives a sublime nuanced performance as vulnerable heroine Clarice Starling . Watch the scenes closely when Clarice is in the company of men , don't you get the feeling she has a phobia about the male of the species . Is she a victim of sexual abuse in her childhood ? A lesbian ? We never find out but Foster's performance is multi layered and it's a pity this aspect is never explored in HANNIBAL which sadly deletes this aspect to Clarice Sadly SILENCE was released with a tidal wave of hype which the film doesn't live up to . Who can forget the stories that upon seeing this at the cinema certain audience members wanted armed escorts back to their cars ! I'm sorry but despite being a good thriller it's not that good and I fail to see how people were turned into quivering jellies unable to sleep with the lights off . I'm also afraid to say that much of the awards heaped upon the film aren't that well deserved either . Foster deserved the Oscar as did the film and possibly Demme too but did Ted Tally for his adapted screenplay ? All he seems to have done is to copy the best bits of Harris's novel wholesale into the screenplay without making an effort to improve anything . and i'll probably be accused of sacrilege but the more times I see this film the more times I ask myself how did Hopkins win the Oscar for Best Actor ? I don't even think Hopkins should have qualified for the Best Actor category since the role isn't on screen long enough and his performance is slightly hammy . Hannibal as played by Hopkins resembles something along the lines of a paedophile rather than a serial killer who has maimed , murdered and munched on adults . Despite having some reservations of Brian Cox as Hannibal in MANHUNTER you do believe his burly presence does have the physical strength to overpower his victims , not so Hopkins I know it's very difficult , perhaps even impossible , but the best way to enjoy this movie is to erase from your mind the fact that it's one of only three movies to have picked up the Oscar in all five main categories , the fact that it made headlines about being the most terrifying film committed to celluloid , and the fact that it stands as the 28th best movie ever on this website . It is a very good thriller but one that is ultimately disappointing after hearing of the hype surrounding it",

            "text": "The Silence of the Lambs (1991) is a classic psychological suspense brilliant masterpiece well acted and the best thriller ever made! This was my first film I saw on VHS as a teenager and I absolutely loved it. Right after seeing this flick, I heard about Hannibal (2001) Ridley Scot film a sequel to this psychological thriller flick, I rushed buying it right away. Saddly I was disappointed with Ridley Scott Hannibal.\"Silence of the Lambs \" is a classic and I think people would agree. It is my number 1 favorite thriller ever made, mostly I have enjoyed Jodie Foster as FBI recruit Clarice Starling's. Jodie did a brilliant acting performance I have seen. I love this film to death I absolutely love everything about this film. Since the first time I saw her in Silence I went to seeing her in a movie theater 2002 Panic Room, it was her first film I saw in movie theater since than I love Jodie Foster but Silence will be her best film she ever made. I was disappointed with the sequel Hannibal, no Jodie Foster in it, no brilliant masterful Clarice. Julianne Moore was incompetent for me, she couldn't catch Hannibal. Clarice Starling character was based on Gillian Anderson's FBI Agent Dana Scully and I think The X-Files inspired this film. I am even convinced that The Lone Gunman three geeks were also based on this film. You have a nice shootout on the end with Clarice and Buffalo Bill and Clarice get's her man, spoils her plans saves the hostage and saves the day.The Silence of the Lambs is the 1991 thriller that was the feature film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and marked the first appearance of Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter. (Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins in one of the greatest performances ever on the screen) Dr.Hannibal \"The Cannibal\" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste (you can interpret that as you like). He is scary and his the same time awesome including brilliant, you can't out smart him. Director Jonathan Demme is masterful directing this flick you have to be brilliant you have to keep thinking to solve the murder mystery. Scott Glenn acts beautiful as Jack Crawford. This flick got five major Academy Awards (\"Oscars\" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) it is no wonder why.Plot: FBI recruit Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is asked by the Bureau to elicit Lecter's help in tracking down a notorious serial killer who has kidnapped a US Senator's daughter. Directed by Jonathan Demme (The Manchurian Candidate), the film would receive five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor for Hopkins and Best Actress for Foster and Best Screenplay. Hopkins would reprise his role as Lecter in two more films: Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002).Real life killer Ed Gein was the inspiration for Buffalo Bill as well as the inspiration for Norman Bates from Psycho and Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. And the director Jonathan Demme was a film student of Roger Corman who makes a cameo in the movie. Roger Corman taught not only him, but I think other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. Ted Levine did a pretty solid job as a serial killer Buffalo Bill. This film is fun, intense, very well fast paced goes quickly around for those two hours.The Silence of the Lambs is a 1991 American horror-thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, and Scott Glenn. The film is based on Thomas Harris' 1988 novel of the same name, his second to feature Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer.In the film, Clarice Starling, a young U.S. FBI trainee, seeks the advice of the imprisoned Dr. Lecter to apprehend another serial killer, known only as \"Buffalo Bill\".This movie is a perfect 10 out of 10, it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth (Jonathan Demme) with a brilliant cast including Thomas Harris novel that was adapted from it. I even saw the Documentary how they were shooting this film on YouTube. I think I do have that documentary film in my Blu-ray special features. Watch this film you want be disappointed at all.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see for fans.",

The story from start to finish is enthralling, and the script is tense and thought-provoking.The Silence of the Lambs is wonderfully acted as well. Jodie Foster is the one who holds the film together and her performance here is one of her most excellent, and I mustn't forget Ted Levine who is very chillingly effective as Buffolo Bill. Anthony Hopkins however steals the film, it is his perhaps most iconic character and he proves that although he is in only a portion of the film his performance lives long in the memory.All in all, amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Jodie Foster seems forcing it, especially when asked to reveal some secret recalling the title of the Book and Movie. There are also some less than brilliantly enticing lectures from Hannibal about coveting and a scribbled note that is laughably sophomoric and we're off to catch the truly creepy Buffalo Bill.Overall it adds up to be less than it seems. Some clever stuff but it is carelessly sewed together and with some tugging starts to unravel.
